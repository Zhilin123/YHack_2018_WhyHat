HOMEOSTASIS
Summary questions
The main source of donor kidneys is from people who die suddenly,
often from road accidents, strokes, and heart attacks. In the UK,
organs can be taken from people if they carry an organ donor card or
are on the online donor register. Alternatively, a relative of someone
who has died suddenly can give his or her consent.
Unfortunately for people needing a transplant, there is a shortage of
donor kidneys. Many people do not register as donors. In addition,
as cars become safer, fewer people die suddenly in traffic accidents.
Whilst good, this means there are fewer potential donors. At any one
time there are thousands of people undergoing kidney dialysis. Most
will not have the opportunity to have a kidney transplant. In 2013-14,
3257 people in the UK had kidney transplants. However, there were
still around 6000 people on dialysis waiting for a kidney. There are
increasing numbers of live donor transplants, where a family member
of someone with a tissue match donates a kidney. In 2013-14, 2143
people received kidneys from donors who had died, and 1114 were
from living donors.
In 2011, scientists grew functioning embryonic kidney tissue from
stem cells. Going forward, the hope is that whole new kidneys can be
grown - perhaps even without the antigens which trigger the immune
reaction so that patients don't need to take immunosuppressant drugs.

15.7 Urine and diagnosis
Specification reference: 5.1.2
For many centuries people have used urine to try and diagnose
diseases by looking at the colour, the smell, and even the taste of it.
Urine is still a useful diagnostic tool, although our methods of analysis
are more sophisticated.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
â†’ how excretory products can
be used in medical diagnosis.
Urine samples and diagnostic tests
Urine contains water, urea, mineral salts - and much more. It contains
the breakdown products of a whole range of chemicals, including
hormones and any toxins taken into the body. If you are affected by
one of a number of different diseases, new substances will show up
in your urine. The presence of glucose in the urine is a well-known
symptom of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. If you have muscle damage,
large amounts of creatinine will show up in your urine.
Urine and pregnancy testing
The human embryo implants in the uterus, around six days after
conception. The site of the developing placenta then begins to produce
a chemical called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Some of
this hormone is found in the blood and the urine of the mother. Until
the 1960s, the most reliable available pregnancy test was to inject the
urine from a pregnant woman into an African clawed toad (Xenopus
laevis). If she was pregnant, the hCG triggered egg production in the
toad within 8-12 hours of the injection. It could not be used until the
woman was several weeks pregnant.
Figure 1 The mixture of urine and
a toad may not sound very scientific
but the combination made a relatively
accurate and available pregnancy test
for many years
Modern pregnancy tests still test for hCG in the urine, but they rely on
monoclonal antibodies. Some are so sensitive that pregnancy can be
detected within hours of implantation.
Making monoclonal antibodies
Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies from a single clone of cells that
are produced to target particular cells or chemicals in the body.
A mouse is injected with hCG so it makes the appropriate antibody. The
B-cells that make the required antibody are then removed from the
spleen of the mouse and fused with a myeloma, a type of cancer cell
which divides very rapidly. This new fused cell is known as a hybridoma.
Each hybridoma reproduces rapidly, resulting in a clone of millions
of 'living factories' making the desired antibody. These monoclonal
antibodies are collected, purified and used in a variety of ways.
Synoptic link
You learnt about the specific
immune system and antibodies
in Topic 12.6, The specific immune
system.
The main stages in a pregnancy test are as follows:
the wick is soaked in the first urine passed in the morning - this
will have the highest levels of hCG.
The test contains mobile monoclonal antibodies that have very
small coloured beads attached to them. They will only bind to
hCG. If the woman is pregnant the hCG in her urine binds to the
mobile monoclonal antibodies and forms a hCG/antibody complex
(complete with coloured bead).

HOMEOSTASIS
The loss of these substances is prevented by careful control of the dialysis
fluid. It contains normal plasma levels of glucose to ensure there is
no net movement of glucose out of the blood. The dialysis fluid also
contains normal plasma levels of mineral ions, so any excess mineral
ions in the blood move out by diffusion down a concentration gradient
into the dialysis fluid, thus restoring the correct electrolyte balance of
the blood. The dialysis fluid contains no urea meaning there is a very
steep concentration gradient from the blood to the fluid, and as a result,
much of the urea leaves the blood. The blood and the dialysis fluid flow
in opposite directions to maintain a countercurrent exchange system and
maximise the exchange that takes place.
The whole process of dialysis depends on diffusion down concentration
gradients - there is no active transport. Dialysis takes about eight hours
and has to be repeated regularly. Patients with kidney failure who rely on
haemodialysis have to remain attached to a dialysis machine several times
a week for many hours. They also need to manage their diets carefully,
eating relatively little protein and salt and monitoring their fluid intake to
keep their blood chemistry as stable as possible. The only time they can
eat and drink what they like is at the beginning of the dialysis process.

Peritoneal dialysis
Peritoneal dialysis is done inside the body - it makes
use of the natural dialysis membranes formed by the
lining of the abdomen, that is, the peritoneum. It is
usually done at home and the patient can carry on
with their normal life while it takes place. The dialysis
fluid is introduced into the abdomen using a catheter.
It is left for several hours for dialysis to take place
across the peritoneal membranes, so that urea and
excess mineral ions pass out of the blood capillaries,
into the tissue fluid, and out across the peritoneal
membrane into the dialysis fluid. The fluid is then
drained off and discarded, leaving the blood balanced
again and the urea and excess minerals removed.

Treating kidney failure by transplant
Long-term dialysis has some serious side effects. The
best solution for the patient is a kidney transplant,
where a single healthy kidney from a donor is placed
within the body. The blood vessels are joined and the
ureter of the new kidney is inserted into the bladder.
If the transplant is successful, the kidney will function
normally for many years.
bladder
bag
The main problem with transplanted organs is the risk
of rejection. The antigens on the donor organ differ
from the antigens on the cells of the recipient and the
immune system is likely to recognise this. This can result
in rejection and the destruction of the new kidney.

The more ADH that is released, the more water

the tubule cells. This makes it easy for more
water to leave the tubules by diffusion, resulting
in the formation of a small amount of very

capillaries, maintaining the water potential of the

by a complex negative feedback system that
involves osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus
of the brain. These osmoreceptors are sensitive to the concentration of
inorganic ions in the blood and are linked to the release of ADH.
When water is in short supply
When water is in short supply in the body, the concentration of inorganic
ions in the blood rises and the water potential of the blood and tissue
fluid becomes more negative. This is detected by the osmoreceptors in
the hypothalamus. They send nerve impulses to the posterior pituitary
which in turn releases stored ADH into the blood. The ADH is picked
up by receptors in the cells of the collecting duct and increases the
permeability of the tubules to water. Water leaves the filtrate in the
tubules and passes into the blood in the surrounding capillary network.
A small volume of concentrated urine is produced (Figure 3).
An excess of water
When large amounts of liquid are taken in the blood becomes more
dilute and its water potential becomes less negative. Again, the
change is detected by the osmoreceptors of the hypothalamus. Nerve
impulses to the posterior pituitary are reduced or stopped and so the
release of ADH by the pituitary is inhibited. Very little reabsorption
of water can take place because the walls of the collecting duct
remain impermeable to water. In this way the concentration of
the blood is maintained - and large amounts of dilute urine are
produced (Figure 3).

The functions of the nephrons
Ultrafiltration
The first stage in the removal of nitrogenous waste and
osmoregulation of the blood is ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration in
the kidney tubules is a specialised form of the process that results
in the formation of tissue fluid in the capillary beds of the body
and it is the result of the structure of the glomerulus and the cells
lining the Bowman's capsule (Figure 9 and 10). The glomerulus
is supplied with blood by a relatively wide afferent (incoming)
arteriole from the renal artery. The blood leaves through a narrower
efferent (outward) arteriole and as a result there is considerable
pressure in the capillaries of the glomerulus. This forces the blood
out through capillary wall â€“ it acts rather like a sieve. Then the fluid
passes through the basement membrane - scientists are increasingly
recognising the basement membrane as an important factor in
the filtration process. The basement membrane is made up of a
network of collagen fibres and other proteins that make up a second
'sieve'. Most of the plasma contents can pass through the basement
membrane but the blood cells and many proteins are retained in the
capillary because of their size.

The wall of the Bowman's capsule also involves special cells

extensions called pedicels that wrap around the capillaries,
forming slits that make sure any cells, platelets, or large plasma
proteins that have managed to get through the epithelial cells
and the basement membrane do not get through into the
tubule itself. The filtrate which enters the capsule contains
glucose, salt, urea, and many other substances in the same
concentrations as they are in the blood plasma (Figure 11 and
Table 1). The process is so efficient that up to 20% of the water
and solutes are removed from the plasma as it passes through
the glomerulus. The volume of blood that is filtered through
the kidneys in a given time is known as the glomerular
filtration rate.

Reabsorption
Ultrafiltration removes urea, the waste product of protein
breakdown, from the blood but it also removes a lot of
water along with the glucose, salt, and other substances
which are present in the plasma. Many of these substances
are needed by the body - for example, glucose is used for
cellular respiration and is never normally excreted. The
ultrafiltrate is also hypotonic to (less concentrated than)
the blood plasma. The main function of the nephron after
the Bowman's capsule is to return most of the filtered
substances back to the blood.

The proximal convoluted tubule
In the proximal convoluted tubule all of the glucose,
amino acids, vitamins, and hormones are moved from the
filtrate back into the blood by active transport. Around
85% of the sodium chloride and water is reabsorbed as
well - the sodium ions are moved by active transport
while the chloride ions and water follow passively down
concentration gradients. The cells lining the proximal
convoluted tubule have clear adaptations:

tubule is isotonic (at same concentration) with the tissue fluid
surrounding the tubule and isotonic with the blood. At this stage

T
ADH, water balance, and blood pressure
The osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus are not the only sensory receptors that
exert control over the release of ADH. It is also stimulated or inhibited by changes
in the blood pressure, detected by baroreceptors in the aortic and carotid
arteries. These baroreceptors are also involved in the control of the heart rate.
A rise in blood pressure can often be caused by a rise in blood volume. The
increase in pressure is detected by the baroreceptors and in turn they
prevent the release of ADH. This increases the volume of water lost in the
urine, reducing the blood volume and so the blood pressure falls.
If the blood pressure falls it can be a signal that the blood volume has fallen.
If the baroreceptors detect a fall in blood pressure there is an increase in the
release of ADH from the pituitary, so the kidneys respond to reduce water
loss from the body. Water is returned to the blood and a small amount of
concentrated urine is produced.
People with severe diarrhoea or more than 20% blood loss often produce
little or no urine. In each case explain why.

Figure 3 A donor kidney takes over the functions of the failed kidneys, which are

There are a number of ways of reducing the risk of rejection. The match
between the antigens of the donor and the recipient is made as close as
possible. For example, a donor kidney can be used with a 'tissue type'
very similar to the recipient (from people with the same blood group).
The recipient is given drugs to suppress their immune response
(immunosuppressant drugs) for the rest of their lives. This helps to
prevent the rejection of their new organ. Immunosuppressant drugs
are improving all the time and the need for a really close tissue match
is becoming less important.
The disadvantage of taking immunosuppressant drugs is that they
prevent the patients from responding effectively to infectious diseases.
They have to take great care if they become ill in any way. However,
most people feel this is a small price to pay for a new, functioning kidney.
Transplanted organs don't last forever with the average transplanted
kidney functioning for around 9-10 years, although some have continued
working for around 50 years. Once the organ starts to fail the patient has
to return to dialysis and wait until another suitable kidney is found.
Synoptic link
Dialysis or transplant?
Dialysis is much more readily available than donor organs, so it is
there whenever kidneys fail. It enables the patient to lead a relatively
normal life. However, patients have to monitor their diet carefully
and need regular sessions on the machine. Long-term dialysis is much
more expensive than a transplant and can eventually cause damage to
the body.
You learnt about stem cells in Topic
6.5, Stem cells.
If a patient receives a kidney transplant they are free from the restrictions
which come with regular dialysis sessions and dietary monitoring. This is
generally the ideal scenario for patients waiting for a transplant.

15.3 Thermoregulation in endotherms
Controlling thermoregulation
The physiological responses of endotherms to changes in the core
temperature are the result of complex homeostatic mechanisms
involving negative feedback control from the hypothalamus. There are
two control centres:
The heat loss centre
This is activated when the temperature of the blood flowing through
the hypothalamus increases. It sends impulses through autonomic
motor neurones to effectors in the skin and muscles, triggering
responses that act to lower the core temperature.
The heat gain centre
This is activated when the temperature of the blood flowing through
the hypothalamus decreases. It sends impulses through the autonomic
nervous system to effectors in the skin and the muscles, triggering
responses that act to raise the core temperature.
Summary questions
1 Why is the control of the
internal temperature so
important to both ectotherms
and endotherms? (6 marks)
The interaction of the sensory receptors, the autonomic nervous
system, and the effectors in a sophisticated feedback system enables

15.5 The structure and function of the mammalian kidney
of ions that is essential for the kidney to produce urine that
is more concentrated than the blood. This is a key part of the
countercurrent multiplier system.
By the time the dilute fluid reaches the top of the ascending limb it is
hypotonic to the blood again, and it then enters the distal convoluted
tubule and collecting duct.
Distal convoluted tubule
Balancing the water needs of the body takes place in the distal
convoluted tubule and the collecting duct. These are the areas where
the permeability of the walls of the tubules varies with the levels of
ADH. The cells lining the distal convoluted tubule also have many
mitochondria so they are adapted to carry out active transport.
If the body lacks salt, sodium ions will be actively pumped out of
the distal convoluted tubule with chloride ions following down an
electrochemical gradient. Water can also leave the distal tubule,
concentrating the urine, if the walls of the tubule are permeable in
response to ADH. The distal convoluted tubule also plays a role in
balancing the pH of the blood.
Study tip
The collecting duct
The collecting duct passes down through the concentrated tissue fluid
of the renal medulla (Figure 3 and 6). This is the main site where the
concentration and volume of the urine produced is determined. Water
moves out of the collecting duct by diffusion down a concentration
gradient as it passes through the renal medulla. As a result the
urine becomes more concentrated. The level of sodium ions in the
surrounding fluid increases through the medulla from the cortex to
the pelvis. This means water can be removed from the collecting duct
all the way along its length, producing very hypertonic urine when
the body needs to conserve water. The permeability of the collecting
duct to water is controlled by the level of ADH, which determines how
much or little water is reabsorbed. You will learn more about the role
of the collecting duct in maintaining the water potential of the blood
in Topic 15.6, The kidney and osmoregulation.
Remember that the amount of
reabsorption that occurs in the
proximal tubule is always the
same, the fine-tuning of the
water balance takes place further
along the nephron.
How long is your loop of Henle?
The ability of animals to produce very concentrated urine depends on
several factors, one is the length of the loop of Henle. As you have seen
the loop of Henle develops the concentration gradient across the kidney
medulla, meaning water can leave the collecting duct all the way through,
concentrating the urine as it goes. Fish have no loop of Henle and cannot
produce urine that is more concentrated than their blood. Desert animals
tend to have lots of nephrons that have very long loops of Henle that travel
deep into the medulla.

The changes that take place in the descending limb of the loop

The descending limb leads from the proximal convoluted
tubule. This is the region where water moves out of
the filtrate down a concentration gradient. The upper
part is impermeable to water but the lower part of the
descending limb is permeable to water and runs down
into the medulla. The concentration of sodium and
chloride ions in the tissue fluid of the medulla gets
higher and higher moving through from the cortex to the
pyramids, as a result of the activity of the ascending limb
of the loop of Henle.
The filtrate entering the descending limb of the loop of
Henle is isotonic with the blood. As it travels down the
limb, water passes out of the loop into the tissue fluid by
osmosis down a concentration gradient. It then moves
down a concentration gradient into the blood of the
surrounding capillaries (the vasa recta).
The descending limb is not permeable to sodium and
chloride ions, and no active transport takes place in
the descending limb. The fluid that reaches the hairpin
bend is very concentrated and hypertonic to the blood
in the capillaries.
The first section of the ascending limb of the loop of
Henle is very permeable to sodium and chloride ions
and they move out of the concentrated solution by
diffusion down a concentration gradient. In the second
section of the ascending limb, sodium and chloride ions
are actively pumped out into the medulla tissue fluid
against a concentration gradient. This produces very high
sodium and chloride ion concentrations in the medulla
tissue. Importantly, the ascending limb of the loop of
Henle is impermeable to water, so water cannot follow
the chloride and sodium ions down a concentration
gradient. This means the fluid left in the ascending
limb becomes increasingly dilute, while the tissue fluid
of the medulla develops the very high concentration

Raising the body hair or feathers
As the body temperature falls, the erector pili muscles in the skin
contract, pulling the hair or feathers of the animal erect. This traps an
insulating layer of air and so reduces cooling through the skin. The
effect can be quite dramatic and it is a very effective way to reduce
heat loss to the environment in many animals. In humans this has
little effect although you can observe the hairs being pulled upright.
Shivering
As the core temperature falls the body may begin to shiver. This is
the rapid, involuntary contracting and relaxing of the large voluntary
muscles in the body. The metabolic heat from the exothermic reactions
warm up the body instead of moving it and is an effective way of
raising the core temperature.
Endotherms living in cold climates often have additional anatomical
adaptations to help them keep warm. Many have adaptations that
minimise their SA:V ratio to reduce cooling (e.g., small ears). Another
common adaptation is a thick layer of insulating fat underneath
the skin, for example, blubber in whales and seals. Some animals
hibernate â€“ they build up fat stores, build a well-insulated shelter, and
lower their metabolic rate so they pass the worst of the cold weather
in a deep sleep-like state.
Figure 5 The effect of the contraction
of the erector pili muscles in robins
Polar bears demonstrate many of the ways in which endotherms can
survive in extremely cold conditions. They have small ears and fur
on their feet to insulate them from the ice. The fur and skin of polar
bears work together. The hairs are hollow so trap a permanent layer
of insulating air. The skin underneath is black, so it absorbs warming
radiation. They have a thick layer of fat under the skin. Polar bears
are so well insulated that their external surfaces are similar in
temperature to the snow and ice on which they live. Females dig
dens in the snow and remain in them, warm and insulated, for
months while they give birth to their cubs, only emerging when the
cubs are large enough to survive the cold. Polar bears are so well
adapted to life in temperatures down to -50Â°C in the Arctic that
they can overheat at temperatures over 10Â°C.

15.3 Thermoregulation in endotherms

Endotherms can regulate their body temperature within a very narrow

thermoregulation possible.

.
Detecting temperature changes
In any homeostatic system receptors are needed to detect a change
in the internal environment. The peripheral temperature receptors
are in the skin and detect changes in the surface temperature.
Temperature receptors in the hypothalamus detect the temperature
of the blood deep in the body. The temperature of the skin is
much more likely to be affected by external conditions than the
temperature of the hypothalamus. The combination of the two
gives the body great sensitivity and allows it to respond not only
to actual changes in the temperature of the blood but to pre-empt
possible problems that might result from changes in the external
environment.
Synoptic link
You learnt about the areas of the
brain in Topic 13.7, Structure and
function of the brain.
The temperature receptors in the hypothalamus act as the thermostat
of the body, controlling the responses that maintain the core
temperature in a dynamic equilibrium to within about 1 Â°C of 37Â°C.
Principles of thermoregulation in endotherms
Endotherms use their internal exothermic metabolic activities to
keep them warm, and energy-requiring physiological responses to
help them cool down. They also have passive ways of heating up
and cooling down, to reduce the energy demands on their bodies.
Like ectotherms, endotherms have a range of behavioural responses
to temperature changes that include basking in the Sun, pressing
themselves to warm surfaces, wallowing in water and mud to cool
down, and digging burrows to keep warm or cool. Some animals
even become dormant through the coldest weather (hibernation) or
through the hottest weather (aestivation is a period of prolonged or
deep sleep similar to hibernation but occurs in summer or during dry
seasons to avoid heat stress rather than cold).
Figure 1 Thermoregulation makes
it possible for endotherms to survive in
many extreme environments
Humans have additional behavioural adaptations to help control
body temperature - clothes are worn to stay warm, houses are
built, and then heated up or cooled down to maintain the ideal
temperature.
In spite of these behavioural responses, endotherms mainly rely on
physiological adaptations to maintain a stable core body temperature,
regardless of the environmental conditions or the amount of exercise
being done. These adaptations include the peripheral temperature
receptors, the thermoregulatory centres of the hypothalamus, the skin,
and muscles.

is very toxic and then to urea. Urea is toxic in high
concentrations but not in the concentrations normally
found in the blood. Urea is excreted by the kidneys
(you will learn about the role of the kidneys in
excretion and water balance in Topics 15.5 and 15.6).
The remainder of the amino acid can then be fed

Vasodilation
The arterioles near the surface of the skin dilate when the
temperature rises. The vessels that provide a direct connection
between the arterioles and the venules (the arteriovenous shunt
vessels) constrict. This forces blood through the capillary networks
close to the surface of the skin. The skin flushes, and cools as a result
of increased radiation. If the skin is pressed against cool surfaces, then
the cooling results from conduction.

Increased sweating
As the core temperature starts to increase, rates of sweating also
increase. Sweat spreads out across the surface of the skin. In some
mammals, including humans and horses, there are sweat glands all
over the body. As the sweat evaporates from the surface of the skin,
heat is lost, cooling the blood below the surface. In some animals,
the sweat glands are restricted to the less hairy areas of the body
such as the paws. These animals often open their mouths and pant
when they get hot, again losing heat as the water evaporates. In
human beings, around 1 dm of sweat is lost by evaporation on a
normal day. If the conditions are very hot and dry or the person
is exercising very hard, up to 12 dm of sweat a day can be lost.
Kangaroos and cats often lick their front legs to keep cool in high
temperatures.
Figure 3 Horses sweat all over
when they are very hot. This horse
is also panting, so he is cooling by
evaporation both from his skin and his
breathing passages. The hair on his body
is also lying very flat to avoid trapping
an insulating layer of air. The dilated
arterioles and venules under the skin take
blood to and from the capillary network
Reducing the insulating effect of hair or feathers
As the body temperature begins to increase, the erector pili muscles
(the hair erector muscles) in the skin relax - as a result, the hair or
feathers of the animal lie flat to the skin. This avoids trapping an
insulating layer of air. It has little effect in humans.
Endotherms that live in hot climates often have anatomical
adaptations as well as the behavioural and physiological adaptations
already described. These minimise the effect of high temperatures and
maximise the ability of the animal to cool down through the surface
area of the body. They include a relatively large surface area: volume
(SA:V) ratio to maximise cooling (e.g., include large ears and wrinkly
skin), and pale fur or feathers to reflect radiation.

homeostasis. These functions will now be explored in more detail.
Synoptic link
You learnt about the interconversion
of glucose to glycogen and the
storage of glycogen in the liver
in Topic 14.3, Regulation of blood

Carbohydrate metabolism
Hepatocytes are closely involved in the homeostatic control of glucose
levels in the blood by their interaction with insulin and glucagon.
When blood glucose levels rise, insulin levels rise and stimulate
hepatocytes to convert glucose to the storage carbohydrate glycogen.
About 100g of glycogen is stored in the liver. Similarly, when blood
sugar levels start to fall, the hepatocytes convert the glycogen back to
glucose under the influence of the hormone glucagon.
Deamination of excess amino acids

Lizards living in colder climates tend to be darker coloured than
lizards living in hotter countries so that they get warmer. Some
ectotherms also alter their heart rate to increase or decrease the
metabolic rate and sometimes to affect the warming or cooling across
the body surfaces.

(2 marks)
b Give two examples of
ectotherms. (1 mark)
Ectotherms are always more vulnerable to fluctuations in the
environment than endotherms. However, by using a variety of
behavioural and physiological strategies many of them can maintain
relatively stable core temperatures. They need less food than
endotherms as they use less energy regulating their temperatures, and
so they can survive in some very difficult habitats where food is in
short supply.

As a result, endotherms survive in a wide range of
environments. Keeping warm in cold conditions

five times higher than ectotherms, so they need to

internal and external temperature on ectotherms and endotherms
using their metabolism - however, they have evolved a
range of behavioural responses that enable them to overcome
the limitations imposed by the temperature of their surroundings.
Behavioural responses
Ectotherms display a number of behaviours which increase or reduce
the radiation they absorb from the Sun. Sometimes they need to warm
up to reach a temperature at which their metabolic reactions happen
fast enough for them to be active. They may bask in the Sun, orientate
their bodies so that the maximum surface area is exposed to the
Sun, and even extend areas of their body to increase the surface area
exposed to the Sun. For example, lizards often bask for long periods of
time to get warm enough to move fast and hunt their prey, and insects
such as locusts and butterflies orientate themselves for maximum
exposure to the Sun and spread their wings to increase the available
surface area to get warm enough to fly.
Ectotherms can increase their body temperature through conduction by
pressing their bodies against the warm ground. They also get warmer
as a result of exothermic metabolic reactions. Galapagos iguanas will
contract their muscles and vibrate increasing cellular metabolism to
raise their body temperature. Similarly, moths and butterflies may
vibrate their wings to warm their muscles before they take flight.
Ectotherms sometimes need to cool down to prevent their core
temperature reaching a point where enzymes begin to denature. To
cool down, many of the warming processes are reversed. Ectotherms
shelter from the sun by seeking shade, hiding in cracks in rocks, or
even digging burrows. They will press their bodies against cool, shady
earth or stones, or move into available water or mud. They orientate
their bodies so that the minimum surface area is exposed to the sun,
and minimise their movements to reduce the metabolic heat generated.
Physiological responses to warming
Much of the thermoregulation by ectotherms is the result of
behavioural responses but some of them have physiological responses

15.4 Excretion, homeostasis,

Many of the chemical reactions of metabolism that take place in the
cells of the body produce waste products that are toxic if they are
allowed to build up. Excretion is the removal of the waste products of
metabolism from the body.

the liver into the small intestine via the gall bladder and bile duct.
They colour the faeces.
Nitrogenous waste products (urea) - formed from the breakdown of
excess amino acids by the liver. All mammals produce urea as their
nitrogenous waste. Fish produce ammonia while birds and insects
produce uric acid. Urea is excreted by the kidneys in the urine.

The liver
The liver is one of the major body organs involved in homeostasis.
It is a reddish brown organ which makes up about 5% of the total
body mass â€“ the largest internal organ of the body. It lies just below
the diaphragm and is made up of several lobes. The liver is very fast
growing and damaged areas generally regenerate very quickly.
The liver has a very rich blood supply - about 1 dm of blood flows
through it every minute. Oxygenated blood is supplied to the liver by the
hepatic artery and removed from the liver and returned to the heart in
the hepatic vein. The liver is also supplied with blood by a second vessel,
the hepatic portal vein. This carries blood loaded with the products of
digestion straight from the intestines to the liver and this is the starting
point for many metabolic activities of the liver (Figure 1). Up to 75% of
the blood flowing through the liver comes via the hepatic portal vein.
The structure of the liver
The liver carries out many different complex functions but the cells
are surprisingly simple and uniform in appearance. Liver cells or
hepatocytes have large nuclei, prominent Golgi apparatus, and lots
of mitochondria, indicating that they are metabolically active cells
(Figure 1). They divide and replicate - even if around 65% of the liver
is lost, it will regenerate in a matter of months.
The blood from the hepatic artery and the hepatic portal vein is mixed
in spaces called sinusoids which are surrounded by hepatocytes. This

15.8 Kidney failure
Specification reference: 5.1.2
The kidneys play a vital role in homeostasis. If they are damaged and
become less efficient or stop working, the effects on the body are
serious and may be fatal if they are not treated.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
â†’ the effects of kidney failure
and its potential treatments.
Causes and effects of kidney failure
There are a number of reasons why the kidneys may fail. They
include kidney infections, where the structure of the podocytes and
the tubules themselves may be damaged or destroyed; raised blood
pressure that can damage the structure of the epithelial cells and
basement membrane of the Bowman's capsule; and genetic conditions
such as polycystic kidney disease where the healthy kidney tissue is
replaced by fluid-filled cysts or damaged by pressure from cysts.
If the kidneys are infected or affected by high blood pressure this
may cause:
Protein in the urine - if the basement membrane or podocytes of
the Bowman's capsule are damaged, they no longer act as filters
and large plasma proteins can pass into the filtrate and are passed
out in the urine.
Blood in the urine - another symptom that the filtering process is
no longer working.
If the kidneys fail completely, the concentrations of urea and mineral
ions build up in the body. The effects include:
Loss of electrolyte balance - if the kidneys fail, the body cannot
excrete excess sodium, potassium, and chloride ions. This causes
osmotic imbalances in the tissues and eventual death.
Build-up of toxic urea in the blood - if the kidneys fail, the body
cannot get rid of urea and it can poison the cells.
High blood pressure - the kidneys play an important role in
controlling the blood pressure by maintaining the water balance
of the blood. If the kidneys fail, the blood pressure increases
and this can cause a range of health problems including heart
problems and strokes.
Weakened bones as the calcium/phosphorus balance in the blood
is lost.
Pain and stiffness in joints as abnormal proteins build up in the blood.
Anaemia - the kidneys are involved in the production of a
hormone called erythropoietin that stimulates the formation of red
blood cells. When the kidneys fail it can reduce the production of
red blood cells causing tiredness and lethargy.
Measuring glomerular filtration rate
Kidney problems almost always affect the rate at which blood is
filtered in the Bowman's capsules of the nephrons. The glomerular

Cirrhosis of the liver
Cirrhosis is a disease where the normal liver tissue is replaced by fibrous
scar tissue. There are lots of different causes including genetic conditions
and hepatitis C, however, in the UK the most common cause is drinking
excessive amounts of alcohol.
There are three stages of alcoholic liver disease - alcoholic fatty liver
disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and liver cirrhosis. In fatty liver, big fat-filled
vesicles displace the nuclei of the hepatocytes and the liver gets larger.
In alcoholic hepatitis, the patient has fatty liver along with damaged
hepatocytes and the sinusoids and hepatic veins become narrowed.
In alcoholic cirrhosis the liver tissue is irreversibly damaged. Many
hepatocytes die and are replaced with fibrous tissue. The hepatocytes can
no longer divide and replace themselves so the liver shrinks and its ability to
deal with toxins in the body decreases.
1 In many cases, if an affected person stops drinking alcohol
the liver may recover. How is this possible?
Many people cannot stop drinking - explain why not and
discuss ways of helping those affected.

Specification reference: 5.1.1
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
â†’ the principles of homeostasis.
The enzyme-controlled reactions of life can only take place if the
conditions are right. The concentration of chemicals such as glucose
and sodium ions must be kept within a narrow range, as must the pH
and water balance of the body fluids, and the core temperature of the
body. Organisms use both chemical and electrical systems to monitor
and respond to any changes from the steady state of the body, and use
the information to maintain a dynamic equilibrium.
Receptors and effectors
It is impossible to maintain a living mammal in a completely stable
state because everything causes minute changes. Instead, the body
maintains a dynamic equilibrium, with small fluctuations over a
narrow range of conditions. This is known as homeostasis.
Receptors and effectors are vital for the body to maintain this dynamic
equilibrium. As you have seen, sensory receptors detect changes in the
internal and external environment of an organism. In homeostasis,
it is essential to monitor changes in the internal environment,
for example, the pH of the blood, core body temperature, and
concentrations of urea and sodium ions in the blood.
Figure 1 Mammals maintain the
conditions inside their body within very
narrow limits wherever they live and
whatever they do
Synoptic link
You learnt about sensory
receptors, sensory and motor
neurones, and coordination in
the brain in Chapter 13, Neuronal
communication.
Information from the sensory receptors is transmitted to the brain and
impulses are sent along the motor neurones to the effectors to bring
about changes to restore the equilibrium in the body. Effectors are
the muscles or glands that react to the motor stimulus to bring about
a change in response to a stimulus. Both are vital in a homeostatic
system - detecting change is no use without the means to react to that
change, but effectors cause chaos unless responding to a need.
Feedback systems
Homeostasis depends on sensory receptors detecting small changes in
the body, and effectors working to restore the status quo. These precise
control mechanisms in the body are based on feedback systems that
enable the maintenance of a relatively steady state around a narrow
range of conditions.
Synoptic link
You learnt about negative
feedback in Chapter 14, Hormonal
communication.
Negative feedback systems
Most of the feedback systems in the body involve negative feedback.
A small change in one direction is detected by sensory receptors. As a
result, effectors work to reverse the change and restore conditions to
their base level. Negative feedback systems work to reverse the initial
stimulus. You have seen negative feedback in action in the control of
blood sugar levels by insulin and glucagon. Negative feedback systems

15.5 The structure and function of
the mammalian kidney
Specification reference: 5.1.2
Human kidneys are typical of all mammalian kidneys. They are a pair
of reddish-brown organs attached to the back of the abdominal cavity.
They are usually surrounded by a thick, protective layer of fat and
a layer of fibrous connective tissue. The kidneys play two important
homeostatic roles in the body - they are involved in excretion and
osmoregulation. They filter nitrogenous waste products out of the
blood, especially urea. They also help to maintain the water balance and
pH of the blood, and hence the tissue fluid that surrounds all the cells.

The anatomy of the kidneys
If you put your hands on your hips, the place where your thumbs are
is the approximate position of your kidneys. The kidneys are supplied
with blood at arterial pressure by the renal arteries that branch off
from the abdominal aorta. Blood that has circulated through the
kidneys is removed by the renal vein that drains into the inferior vena
cava. About 90-120 cm of blood passes through the kidneys every
minute. All of the blood in the body passes through the kidneys about
once an hour. The kidneys filter 180 dm of blood a day, producing
1-2 dm of urine. The final volume depends on many different factors.
You will learn more about the factors that determine the amount of
urine produced in Topic 15.6, The kidney and osmoregulation.
vena cava
aorta
renal artery
renal vein

ureter
The kidneys are made up of millions of small structures called
nephrons that act as filtering units. The sterile liquid produced by
the kidney tubules is called urine. The urine passes out of the kidneys
down tubes called ureters. It is collected in the bladder, a muscular
sac that can store around 400-600 cm of urine. When the bladder
is getting full, the sphincter at the exit to the bladder opens and the
urine passes out of the body down the urethra.
bladder
urethra
Figure 1 The human urinary system
Kidney structure
If you slice open a kidney, you will see three main areas - the cortex
the medulla, and the pelvis (Figure 2).
The cortex is the dark outer layer. This is where the filtering of
the blood takes place and it has a very dense capillary network
carrying the blood from the renal artery to the nephrons.
The medulla is lighter in colour - it contains the tubules of the
nephrons that form the pyramids of the kidney and the collecting ducts.
The pelvis (which is Latin for basin) of the kidney is the central
chamber where the urine collects before passing out down the ureter.
Nephrons - the functional units of the kidney
In the nephrons the blood is filtered and then the majority of the
filtered material is returned to the blood, removing nitrogenous

filtration rate (GFR) is widely used as a measure to indicate kidney
disease. The rate of filtration is not measured directly - a simple
blood test measures the level of creatinine in the blood. Creatinine is
a breakdown product of muscles and it is used to give an estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The units are cm/min. If the levels
of creatinine in the blood go up, it is a signal that the kidneys are not
working properly. Certain factors need to be taken into account in the
calculations to work out GFR. For example, GFR decreases steadily
with age even if you are healthy, and men usually have more muscle
mass and therefore more creatinine than women.

Treating kidney failure with dialysis
As you can see in Table 1, normal GFRs do not fall below 70 even in
very elderly people. A GFR of below 60 for more than three months is
taken to indicate moderate to severe chronic kidney disease - and if it
falls below 15, that is kidney failure. The kidneys are filtering so little
blood they are virtually ineffective.
There are two main ways in which kidney failure is treated. In renal
dialysis, the function of the kidneys is carried out artificially. In a
transplant, a new healthy kidney is put into the body to replace the
functions of the failed kidneys - an animal can function perfectly well
with just one healthy kidney.
There are two main types of dialysis - haemodialysis and peritoneal
dialysis.
Haemodialysis
This involves the use of a dialysis machine. It is usually carried out in
hospital although sometimes patients will have a machine in their own
home. Blood leaves the patient's body from an artery and flows into the
dialysis machine, where it flows between partially permeable dialysis
membranes. These membranes mimic the basement membrane of the
Bowman's capsule. On the other side of the membranes is the dialysis
fluid. During dialysis it is vital that patients lose the excess urea and
mineral ions that have built up in the blood. It is equally important that
they do not lose useful substances such as glucose and some mineral ions.

Ectotherms
Most animals are ectotherms and use their surroundings to warm

include all the invertebrate animals, along with fish, amphibians, and
reptiles.
Synoptic link
You learnt about the properties of
water in Topic 3.2, Water.
Many ectotherms living in water do not need to thermoregulate.
The high heat capacity of water means that the temperature of
their environment does not change much. Ectotherms that live on
land have a much bigger problem with temperature regulation. The
temperature of the air can vary dramatically both between seasons
and even over a 24-hour period from the middle of the day to the end
of the night. As a result ectotherms have evolved a range of strategies
that enable them to cool down or warm up.
Endotherms
Mammals and birds are endotherms. They rely on their metabolic
processes to warm up and they usually maintain a very stable core

Figure 6 Labelled photo of a dissected kidney
Dissecting a kidney cannot show us the histology of
the kidneys. To observe the structure of the individual
nephrons requires a hand-lens or stained sections of
kidney tissue and a microscope. It is very difficult to see
an entire tubule but different parts of the tubules can
be identified (Figures 7 and 8). To make the nephrons
more visible a drop of hydrogen peroxide can be applied
onto the cut surface of the kidney (wearing safety
glasses and gloves). There will be rapid effervescence
(foaming), after this is wiped off, the renal tubules,
collecting duct, and loops of Henle should be a little
clearer to see as shown by strings of bubbles.
In a section through the cortex you will see Bowman's
capsules and glomeruli, as well as sections through
proximal and distal convoluted tubules. The lumen of
the distal tubules tends to be bigger and more open
than those of proximal tubules which can be helpful in
identifying them.
In a section through the medulla you will see mainly
loops of Henle and collecting duct. In a transverse
section you will see the lumens of the tubules - the
collecting ducts are larger than the thick ascending
loops of Henle while the thin-walled descending limbs
are only visible at very high magnifications. In a
longitudinal section you will see the parallel tubes - low
magnifications give an overall impression whilst higher
magnifications enable you to see individual tubules.

Positive feedback systems
There are relatively few positive feedback systems in the body. In a
positive feedback system, a change in the internal environment of the
body is detected by sensory receptors, and effectors are stimulated to
reinforce that change and increase the response. One example occurs
in the blood clotting cascade. When a blood vessel is damaged, platelets
stick to the damaged region and they release factors that initiate clotting
and attract more platelets. These platelets also add to the positive
feedback cycle and it continues until a clot is formed. Another example
of a positive feedback mechanism is seen during childbirth. The head
of the baby presses against the cervix, stimulating the production of the
hormone oxytocin. Oxytocin stimulates the uterus to contract, pushing
the head of the baby even harder against the cervix and triggering the
release of more oxytocin. This continues until the baby is born.
