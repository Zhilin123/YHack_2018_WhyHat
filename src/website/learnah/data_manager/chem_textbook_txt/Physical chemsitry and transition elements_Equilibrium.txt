1 If the concentration of a species is increased, the equilibrium
position shifts in the direction that reduces the concentration.
2 If the pressure is increased, the equilibrium position shifts towards
the side with fewer gaseous moles.
3 If the temperature is increased, the equilibrium position shifts in
the endothermic direction.
So why does le Chatelier's principle work? The answer lies with
equilibrium constants.

Do equilibrium constants change?
The magnitude of an equilibrium constant K indicates the extent of a
chemical equilibrium.
Synoptic link
You first encountered the
relationship between the value of
Kand the extent of an equilibrium
reaction in Topic 10.5, The
equilibrium constant K - part 1.
• K = 1 indicates an equilibrium halfway between reactants and
products.
K= 100 indicates an equilibrium well in favour of the products.
• K= 1 x 10-2 indicates an equilibrium well in favour of the reactants.
The value of K gives the exact position of equilibrium. When the
reactants or products of a reversible reaction are mixed together, the
reaction proceeds until the concentrations of the equilibrium species
give the value of K when placed in the equilibrium constant expression.
At a set temperature, K is constant and does not change despite any
modifications to concentration, pressure, or the presence of a catalyst.
But K does change if the temperature is changed - a temperature
change is the only condition that will causes K to change its value.
The effect of temperature on equilibrium constants K
The value of K is changed by altering the temperature. Whether the
value of K gets larger or smaller depends on whether the forward
reaction is exothermic or endothermic.
Exothermic reactions
If the forward reaction is exothermic:
the equilibrium constant decreases with increasing temperature
raising the temperature decreases the equilibrium yield of products.

6 Worked example: Calculating K for a heterogeneous
equilibrium
When calcium carbonate, Caco,, is heated in a closed system,
a heterogeneous equilibrium is set up. It is a heterogeneous
equilibrium because there is a mixture of solids and a gas.
CaCO3(s) = CaO(s) + CO2(g)
solid solid gas
In the equilibrium mixture, CO, has a partial pressure of
2.5 x 10-2 atm at 600°C. Calculate K.
Step 1: Write down the expression for K.
Only gaseous species are included in the K, expression.
Ko = P(CO2)
Step 2: Calculate Ky
K = 2.5 x 10-2 atm

By le Chatelier's principle, you would also predict a shift in the

The same principle could have been shown using K for the equilibrium

For the same equilibrium as above, a doubling of pressure will result in a
doubling of the partial pressures and concentration of both NO, and N, 02-
Consider the following equilibrium:
N,O2(g) = 2NO,(g)
At a constant temperature, the equilibrium partial pressures are:

• P(N,0.) = 0.24 atm

6 Worked example: Calculating partial pressures
Use the mole fractions of the gases in air to calculate the partial
pressures of gases in air at a pressure of 100 kPa.
Step 1: Calculate partial pressure of nitrogen.
p(N,) = x(N) x P = 0.78 x 100 = 78 kPa
Step 2: Calculate partial pressure of oxygen.
p(02) = x(02) * P = 0.21 x 100 = 21 kPa
Study tip
Always check your calculations:
Step 3: Calculate partial pressure of other gases.
p = x x P = 0.01 x 100 = 1 kPa
The sum of the partial pressures equals the total pressure
78 +21 + 1 = 100 kPa
sum of mole fractions = 1
sum of partial pressures =
total pressure
Dissolving oxygen in the blood
You breathe as a way of getting oxygen into your blood and getting carbon
dioxide out. But how does it work?
The amount of oxygen that can dissolve in the blood is proportional to
the partial pressure of oxygen breathed into the lungs. At equilibrium in
the lungs, each cubic decimetre of the blood can dissolve about 3 cm of
gaseous oxygen. An adult human only has about 5 dm of blood and so
15 cm of oxygen does not seem much. Luckily, as quickly as the oxygen
dissolves, it combines with haemoglobin in the blood. This allows more than
200 cm of oxygen to effectively dissolve in each dm of blood.
Normal air at 1 atmosphere pressure has a pressure of 101 kPa. The 21% of
oxygen in the air has a partial pressure of just over 21 kPa.
On Earth, as altitude increases, the atmospheric pressure decreases (Table 1).
Table 1 Altitude and pressure
Altitude/m sea level 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000
Pressure/kPa 101 81 63 49 38 29
So how do people survive at altitude? The body compensates by producing
more haemoglobin, but at very high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen
may be so small that very little may dissolve.
High altitude mountaineers compensate by using oxygen tanks and
breathing pure oxygen.
1 Why does less oxygen dissolve in the blood with increasing altitude?
Mount Everest has an altitude of 8848 m above sea level.
a Estimate the partial pressure of oxygen at the summit of Mount
Everest.
b Without breathing apparatus, estimate the volume of oxygen that
can be dissolved per dm3 of blood at the top of Mount Everest?
c Breathing pure oxygen at altitude allows mountaineers to breathe
normally. However, breathing pure oxygen for a length of time at
lower altitudes is unhealthy. Suggest why there is a difference.

19.2 The equilibrium constant K.
Study tip
The equilibrium constant K
K, is written in a similar way to K, but with partial pressures replacing
concentration terms.
For the equilibrium:
You should never use square
brackets [ ] when writing
expressions for K . Expressions for
K involve partial pressures, not
concentration. This is a common
error made by students.

P(HI)2
H.(g) + 1, (g) = 2HI(g) App(H) x p(I.)
p is the equilibrium partial pressure.
8) +12(g) = 2HI(g)
Suitable units for partial pressures are kilopascals (kPa), pascals (Pa),
or atmospheres (atm) - but the same unit must be used for all gases.
As with concentration terms for K, the power of a partial pressure in
the K, expression is the balancing number in the chemical equation.
K only includes gases because only gases have partial pressures. Any
other species must be ignored.

DWorked example: Calculating K, for a homogeneous
equilibrium
Nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia coexist in a homogeneous
equilibrium, with all species being gases:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) = 2NH3(g)
This equilibrium reaction is very important, since it is used in the
industrial production of ammonia (Figure 2).
An equilibrium mixture at 400°C contains 18 mol of N, (g),
54 mol of H, (g), and 48 mol NH (g). The total equilibrium
pressure is 200 atm. Use this information to calculate K.
Step 1: Find the mole fractions of nitrogen, hydrogen, and
ammonia
Total number of gas moles = 18 +54 +48 = 120 mol
x{N,) - 128 X(H,) = 120 X(NH3) = 12
Step 2: Find the partial pressures.
p(N) = 18 × 200 = 30 atm
p(H2) = 120 x 200 = 90 atm
P(NH2) = 180 x 200 = 80 atm

How does a catalyst affect equilibrium constants?
Equilibrium constants are unaffected by the presence of a catalyst.
Catalysts affect the rate of a chemical reaction but not the position
of equilibrium.
Catalysts speed up both the forward and reverse reactions in the
equilibrium by the same factor.
Equilibrium is reached quicker but the equilibrium position is not
changed.

19.2 The equilibrium constant K
Specification reference: 5.1.2
Mole fraction and partial pressure
Equilibria involving gases are usually expressed in terms of K, the
equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures. For gases, it is easier
to measure pressure than concentration. Concentration and pressure
are proportional to one another and K, has a direct relationship to K.
To understand how to calculate K, you will first need to understand
mole fractions and partial pressure.

Mole fraction
Under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, the same
volume of different gases contains the same number of moles of gas
molecules.
The mole fraction of a gas is the same as its proportion by volume to
the total volume of gases in a gas mixture.
Synoptic Link
In Topic 2.3, Formulae and
equations, you learnt that 1 mole
of gas molecules occupies
24.0 dm3 at RTP.
For a gas A in a gas mixture:
number of moles of A
mole fraction X(A) =
total number of moles in gas mixture
As with all fractions, the sum of the mole fractions in a gas mixture
must equal one.
You also learnt about the ideal
gas equation which allows gas
volumes to be calculated at any
temperature and pressure.
Worked example: Calculating mole fractions
Air has approximate molar proportions of 78% N, (g), 21% 0,(g),
and 1% other gases. Calculate the mole fractions of the gases in air.
Step 1: Mole fraction of N, x(N,) = 108 = 0.78
Step 2: Mole fraction of O, x(02) = 200 = 0.21
Step 3: Mole fraction of other gases x = 100 = 0.01
Sum of mole fractions equals 1 0.78 + 0.21 + 0.01 = 1
Partial pressure
In a gas mixture, the partial pressure p of a gas is the contribution
that the gas makes towards the total pressure P. The sum of the partial
pressures of each gas equals the total pressure.
For gas A in a gas mixture:
partial pressure p(A) = mole fraction of A x total pressure P
P(A) = x(A) XP

At equilibrium: K. =_p(NO)

K increases from 5 x 10-13 to 4 x 10-8 atm-!

• the ratio
in p(NO)_ is now less than K
p(N2) * p(O2)
The equilibrium partial pressures that gave a K value of 5 x 10-13 at
700K must change to give the new K, value of 4 x 10-8 at 1100K.

. the partial pressures of the reactants N, and 0, must decrease

p(N2) * P(02)
What about K?
The explanations for K, work also for K. If you were supplied with K.
information, just use concentrations instead of partial pressures.
How do changes in concentration and pressure
affect equilibrium constants?
The value of an equilibrium constant K is unaffected by changes in
concentration or pressure. This may seem strange as you know from
le Chatelier's principle that the equilibrium position can be shifted by
changes in concentration or pressure. The equilibrium shift actually
results from the very fact that the equilibrium constant does not change.
Study tip
It is important to realise that
changes in concentration do not
change K. The ratio of reactants to
products changes. The ratio then
changes to get back to K - this
is why the equilibrium position
shifts.
Equilibrium constants and concentration changes
Consider the following equilibrium:

The equilibrium constant K.
You have already seen how to write the equilibrium constant K for an
equilibrium system in terms of the equilibrium concentrations of the
species present at equilibrium.
For example, the expression for K for the equilibrium reaction
N2(g) + 3H2(g) = 2NH3(g) is:
INH,(g)12
[N, (g)] [H2(g)]
You also learnt how to calculate the numerical value for K from the
equilibrium concentrations. You were able to then compare values
of K - the larger the value, the further the position of equilibrium
towards the products. This topic looks at how K can be calculated
from experimental results.

top and bottom of the equilibrium constant term. To work out the units:

EQUILIBRIUM
Homogeneous and heterogeneous equilibria
Equilibria are divided into two main types - homogeneous and
heterogeneous.
Homogeneous equilibria
A homogeneous equilibrium contains equilibrium species that all
have the same state or phase. In all the examples above and the one
below, the equilibria are homogeneous since all the equilibrium
species have the same state and are gases:
N2(g) + 3H,(g) = 2NH2(g)
homogeneous - all species are gases
Heterogeneous equilibria
A heterogeneous equilibrium contains equilibrium species that
have different states or phases. For example, in the equilibrium below
carbon is a solid but the other three species are all gases.
C(s) + H2O(g) = CO(g) + H2(g) heterogeneous - mixture of states
In homogeneous equilibria, the K expression contains concentrations
of all species. However, in heterogeneous equilibria, the concentration
of solids and liquids are essentially constant. So any species that
are solids and liquids are omitted from the K expression. They are
automatically incorporated within the overall equilibrium constant.
K only includes species that are (g) or (aq).
So for the equilibrium above, C(s) is constant and is omitted:
[CO(g)] [H,(g)]
units = moldm-3
