CARBONYLS AND CARBOXYLIC ACIDS
Addition (Step 1)
The lone pair of electrons from the nucleophile is attracted to and donated to
the 6+ carbon atom in the C=0 group of the acyl chloride.
A dative covalent bond is formed between the nucleophile and the carbonyl
carbon atom. The -bond of the CEO group breaks, forming a negatively
charged intermediate.
Elimination (Step 2)
A lone pair of electrons on oxygen reforms the C=0 double bond, causing
a chloride ion to be removed. A proton is also then lost to complete the
elimination. For simplicity, the loss of Cl- followed by H+ have been shown
together in the second step of the mechanism.
The mechanism is called nucleophilic addition-elimination.

Distinguishing between aldehydes and ketones
Once a compound has been identified as containing a carbonyl
group using 2,4-DNP, a fresh sample of the compound can be further
classified as either an aldehyde or a ketone using Tollens' reagent -a
solution of silver nitrate in aqueous ammonia. In the presence of an
aldehyde group, a silver mirror is produced.
Testing for the aldehyde group with Tollens' reagent
Tollens' reagent has a short shelf-life and should be made
up immediately before carrying out the test, as follows:
1 In a clean test tube, add 3 cm depth of aqueous silver
nitrate, A
2 Add aqueous sodium hydroxide to the silver nitrate
until a brown precipitate of silver oxide, Ag, 0,

Reaction of carbonyl compounds with HCN
Hydrogen cyanide, HCN, adds across the C=0 bond of aldehydes and
ketones. Hydrogen cyanide is a colourless, extremely poisonous liquid
that boils slightly above room temperature, so it cannot be used safely
in an open laboratory. Sodium cyanide and sulfuric acid are used to
provide the hydrogen cyanide in the reaction, but the reaction is still
potentially very hazardous.
The reaction is very useful as it provides a means of increasing the
length of the carbon chain. The reaction of propanal with hydrogen
cyanide is shown in Figure 11.

26.3 Carboxylic acids
Specification reference: 6.1.3
The carboxyl group
A carboxylic acid is an organic acid which contains the carboxyl
functional group. The carboxyl group (Figure 1) contains both a
carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group.
You will find carboxylic acids in medicines, fruit juices, vinegar, and
even in rhubarb leaves.
Although many carboxylic acids are useful in their own right, carboxylic
acids and their derivatives are used in organic synthesis as starting
materials or intermediates in the formation of more useful compounds.
The painkiller, aspirin, can be synthesised from salicylic acid (Figure 2).

Naming carboxylic acids
To name a carboxylic acid, the carboxylic acid (carboxyl) functional
group is indicated by adding the suffix -oic acid to the stem of the longest
carbon chain. The carboxyl carbon atom is always designated as carbon-1.
Take special care here. The
functional group is the carboxyl
group, COOH. Don't be fooled into
quoting both CEO and OH groups.
The chemistry is changed entirely
when the OH is attached to the
carbon atom of the C=0.

For details of the rules for naming
organic compounds, see Topic 11.2,
Nomenclature of organic compounds.
Step 1: There are four carbons in the longest chain, so the stem
is but-.
Step 2: The -COOH functional group is on the end of the chain
so the suffix is -oic acid.
Step 3: There is a suffix that is followed with a vowel - the
alkane chain ending is shortened to -an-.
Step 4: There is a methyl group on carbon-3, so the prefix
3-methyl is added to the name.
Step 5: The compound is 3-methylbutanoic acid.

Solubility of carboxylic acids
The C=0 and 0-H bonds in carboxylic acids are polar allowing
carboxylic acids to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules
(Figure 4).
Carboxylic acids with up to four carbon atoms are soluble in water.
As the number of carbon atoms increases, the solubility decreases
as the non-polar carbon chain has a greater effect on the overall
polarity of the molecule.

Dicarboxylic acids have two polar carboxyl groups to form hydrogen
bonds. They are solids at room temperature and dissolve readily in water.
Strength of carboxylic acids
Carboxylic acids are classified as weak acids. Methanoic acid, HCOOH,
is the simplest carboxylic acid containing only one carbon atom. When
dissolved in water, carboxylic acids partially dissociate:
HCOOH(aq) = H+(aq) + HCOO-(aq)
For more details of the dissociation
of weak acids and reactions of
acids, see Topic 4.1, Acids, bases,
and neutralisation, and Topic 20.1,

Acid reactions of carboxylic acids
Carboxylic acids take place in redox and neutralisation reactions:
redox reactions with metals
neutralisation reactions with bases (alkalis, metal oxides, and
carbonates).
In these reactions, carboxylic acids form carboxylate salts. The

26.1 Carbonyl compounds
The organic product formed from the reaction of an aldehyde with
hydrogen cyanide contains two functional groups, a hydroxyl group,
-OH, and a nitrile group, C=N. These compounds are classed as
hydroxynitriles (or cyanohydrins).
Mechanism for nucleophilic addition to
carbonyl compounds
The carbon atom in the C=0 double bond is electron deficient
and attracts nucleophiles. Aldehydes and ketones both react by
nucleophilic addition to form alcohols.
Study tip
Addition to carbonyl groups usually
consists of two steps:
The mechanism for the reaction with NaBH,
In this nucleophilic addition reaction, NaBH, can be considered as
containing the hydride ion, :H®, which acts as the nucleophile.
1 The lone pair of electrons from the hydride ion, :H”, is attracted
and donated to the 8+ carbon atom in the aldehyde or ketone
C=O double bond.
2 A dative covalent bond is formed between the hydride ion and the
carbon atom of the C=O double bond.
The T-bond in the C=O double bond breaks by heterolytic fission,
forming a negatively charged intermediate.
4 The oxygen atom of the intermediate donates a lone pair
of electrons to a hydrogen atom in a water molecule. The
intermediate has then been protonated to form an alcohol.
The mechanism for the reaction of propanone with NaBH, is shown in
Figure 12.

What is a derivative of a carboxylic acid?
A derivative of a carboxylic acid is a compound that can be hydrolysed
to form the parent carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acid derivatives have
a common sequence of atoms in their structure, known as an acyl
group. The acyl group is shown in Figure 1.
Esters, acyl chlorides, acid anhydrides, and amides are all derivatives
of carboxylic acids (Figure 2).

Esters
An ester is named after the parent carboxylic acid from which it is
derived. To name an ester, remove the coic acid suffix from the parent
carboxylic acid and replace with coate. The alkyl chain attached to the
oxygen atom of the COO group is then added as the first word in the
name (Figure 3).

Study tip
You are not expected to know the
structure of 2,4-DNP.
Testing for the carbonyl group with 2,4-DNP
In practical work, 2,4-DNP is normally used dissolved in methanol
and sulfuric acid as a pale orange solution called Brady's reagent. Solid
2,4-DNP can be very hazardous because friction or a sudden blow can
cause it to explode.
Testing for the carbonyl group in aldehydes and ketones
The method for carrying out this test is outlined below.
1 Add 5 cm depth of a solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to a clean
test-tube. This is in excess.
2 Using a dropping pipette, add three drops of the unknown compound.
Leave to stand.
3 If no crystals form, add a few drops of sulfuric acid.
A yellow/orange precipitate (Figure 2) indicates the presence of an
aldehyde or ketone.
The test tube containing the yellow/orange precipitate can then be put to
one side and analysed later to identify the aldehyde or ketone that formed
the precipitate.

Neutralisation reactions of carboxylic acids with bases
Carboxylic acids react with all bases – metal oxides, alkalis, and
carbonates. These reactions are all examples of neutralisation.
Reaction with metal oxides
Carboxylic acids react with metal oxides to form a salt and water. The
equation below shows the reaction of aqueous ethanoic acid with
calcium oxide to form calcium ethanoate and water:
2CH,COOH(aq) + Cao(s) (CH,C00-),Ca2+ (aq) + H2O(l)
When writing the formula of the salt,
you can include or omit charges.
If you do show charges, you must
show them all, otherwise the
equation is unbalanced by charge.
So both (CH,CH_C00-), Mg2and
(CH,CH,COO),Mg are acceptable.
Reaction with alkalis
Carboxylic acids react with alkalis to form a salt and water. In this
reaction, you may not see any reaction as two solutions react together
to form an aqueous solution of the salt. Ethanoic acid reacts with
sodium hydroxide to form sodium ethanoate and water.
Overall: CH,COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → CH,COO-Na+(aq) + H2O(l)
Ionic H+ (aq) + OH(aq) + H20(1)
Reaction with carbonates
When a carbonate is added to a carboxylic acid, carbon dioxide gas
is evolved. If the carboxylic acid is in excess a solid carbonate would
disappear. The equation below shows the reaction of ethanoic acid
with aqueous sodium carbonate:
2CH2COOH(aq) + Na,Co,(aq) — 2CH,COO-Nat(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
Test for the carboxyl group
The neutralisation reaction of carboxylic acids with carbonates, for
example, sodium carbonate, provides chemists with a method of
distinguishing carboxylic acids from any other organic compounds.
Carboxylic acids are the only common organic compounds
sufficiently acidic to react with carbonates. This is especially useful for
distinguishing carboxylic acids from phenols. Phenols are not acidic
enough to react with carbonates.

Step 1: There are eight carbons in the longest chain, so the
stem is oct-.
Step 2: The-C=O functional group is on the end of the chain,
an aldehyde, so the suffix is -al.
Step 3: The aldehyde carbon is carbon-1 but this is not included
in the name.
Step 4: There is a suffix starting with a vowel so the alkane chain
ending is shortened to -an-.
Step 5: The compound is octanal.
Octanal in nature
Octanal, CH (CH), CHO, is a colourless fragrant liquid, one of
a number of molecules responsible for the smell of oranges.
during the breeding seasons. Mating pairs spread this
scent over each other as part of their breeding ritual.
Octanal occurs naturally in citrus oils and is used
commercially as a component of perfumes and in flavour
production for the food industry.

Ketones do not undergo oxidation reactions. This lack of reactivity
provides chemists with a way of distinguishing between aldehydes
and ketones. In Topic 26.2, you will learn more about the chemical
tests that can be used to show the presence of a carbonyl group, and to
distinguish aldehydes from ketones.

The C=0 double bond
The reactivity of aldehydes and ketones is influenced by the nature of
the carbon-oxygen double bond. The double bond is made up of both
a o-bond and a T-bond (Figure 7).

Synoptic link
Review the (=C double bond in
alkenes from Topic 13.1, Properties
of alkenes, which is also made up
of a o-bond and a T-bond.
You may think that carbonyl compounds would react in the same
way as the alkenes, since carbonyl and alkene functional groups both
contain a double bond. However, there is a significant difference in the
nature of the double bond, which makes the reactions rather different.
The C=C double bond in alkenes is non-polar.
• The C=O double bond in carbonyl compounds is polar.
Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. The electron density in
the double bond lies closer to the oxygen atom than to the carbon.
This makes the carbon end of the bond slightly positive and the
oxygen end slightly negative (Figure 8).
Due to the polarity of the CEO double bond, aldehydes and ketones
react with some nucleophiles. A nucleophile is attracted to and
attacks the slightly positive carbon atom resulting in addition across
the CEO double bond.
The reaction type is nucleophilic addition.

Reaction of acyl chlorides with ammonia and amines to form amides
Ammonia and amines can act as nucleophiles by donating the lone
pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom to an electron-deficient species.
Their reaction with acyl chlorides forms amides.
Ammonia reacts with acyl chlorides, forming a primary amide. In the
primary amide the nitrogen atom is attached to one carbon atom. The

Reactions of acid anhydrides

chlorides and are useful for some laboratory preparations where acyl
chlorides may be too reactive.

The mechanism of the reaction between acyl
chlorides and nucleophiles
You have already seen how nucleophiles react with haloalkanes and
carbonyl compounds. It should come as no surprise then that acyl chlorides
also react with nucleophiles. Carbonyl compounds undergo addition whereas
haloalkanes undergo substitution, so what about acyl chlorides which
contain both CEO and Cl?
The mechanism (Figure 18) shows water as the nucleophile. The mechanism
has two steps - addition followed by elimination - containing features of
both carbonyl and haloalkane chemistry.

the mechanism of nucleophilic
addition in these reactions.
Aldehydes
In aldehydes the carbonyl functional group is found at the end of a
carbon chain. The carbon atom of the carbonyl group is attached to
one or two hydrogen atoms. In its structural formula, the aldehyde
group is written as CHO.
The structure of the simplest aldehyde, methanal, HCHO, is shown in
Figure 1. The common name for methanal is formaldehyde, which is
used in solution to preserve biological specimens.
Ketones
In ketones, the carbonyl functional group is joined to two carbon
atoms in the carbon chain. In its structural formula, the ketone group
is written as CO.
The simplest ketone, propanone, CH,COCH,, contains three carbon
atoms (Figure 2). The common name for propanone is acetone, which
is used as an important industrial solvent and is also used in nail-
varnish removers.
Figure 1 Methanal, HCHO, is
the simplest aldehyde. Biological
specimens are preserved in methanal
(formaldehyde)
Naming carbonyl compounds
From the rules for naming organic compounds, you should be able to
work out that the aldehyde and ketone functional groups are indicated
by adding a suffix to the stem of the longest carbon chain:
-al for an aldehyde
-one for a ketone.
In an aldehyde, the carbon atom of the carbonyl group is always
designated as carbon-1, whereas in a ketone the carbonyl carbon atom
needs to be numbered.

Hydrolysis of esters
Esters can be hydrolysed by aqueous acid or alkali. Hydrolysis is the
chemical breakdown of a compound in the presence of water or in
aqueous solution.
Acid hydrolysis
Acid hydrolysis of an ester is the reverse of esterification.
To carry out acid hydrolysis:
The ester is heated under reflux with dilute aqueous acid.
• The ester is broken down by water, with the acid acting as a
catalyst.
The products of acid hydrolysis are a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, as
shown in Figure 8.

Esterification
Esterification is the reaction of an alcohol with a carboxylic acid to
form an ester. An alcohol is warmed with a carboxylic acid with a
small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid, which acts as a catalyst.
Esters are sweet-smelling liquids.
In the reaction shown in Figure 6, ethanol reacts with propanoic acid
to produce an ester, ethyl propanoate, and water. The name of the

The molecular formula for ethyl propanoate is C H 0,. It is a

in some fruits like kiwi fruit and strawberries.
Making ethylpropanoate
You will notice that you now have oily drops of the ester
floating on the water. You will also be able to smell the
aroma of the ester you have made. (Don't make a habit of
inhaling smells in the laboratory - some compounds are
poisons or carcinogens.)
It is easy to make a sample of an ester in the laboratory.
1 Pour 2 cm of ethanol and 2 cm of propanoic acid
into a boiling tube.
2 Carefully add a few drops of concentrated sulfuric
acid to the mixture.
3 Place the boiling tube in a beaker of hot water at
about 80°C.
4 Leave the boiling tube in the water for about five
minutes.
Pour the contents of the boiling tube into a beaker
containing aqueous sodium carbonate. (Sodium
carbonate is a weak base and neutralises the acids in
the mixture. This removes the smell of any carboxylic
acid that has not reacted, making it easier to detect
the smell of the ester.)
