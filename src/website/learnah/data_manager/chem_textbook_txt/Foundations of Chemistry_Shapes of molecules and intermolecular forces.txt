Molecular shapes from four electron pairs
Methane, CH,, ammonia, NH,, and water, H,O all have four electron
pairs surrounding the central atom, but in ammonia and water the
electron pairs are a mixture of bonded pairs and lone pairs.
The four electron pairs around the central atom repel one another
as far apart as possible into a tetrahedral arrangement.
Lone pairs repel more strongly than bonded pairs.
Therefore, lone pairs repel bonded pairs slightly closer together,
decreasing the bond angle - the angle between the bonded pairs
of electrons.
The bond angle is reduced by about 2.5° for each lone pair.

Electron-pair repulsion theory
An electron has a negative charge, so electron pairs repel one another.
The electron-pair repulsion theory is a model used in chemistry for
explaining and predicting the shapes of molecules and polyatomic ions.
The electron pairs surrounding a central atom determine the shape
of the molecule or ion.
The electron pairs repel one another so that they are arranged as
far apart as possible.
The arrangement of electron pairs minimises repulsion and thus
holds the bonded atoms in a definite shape.
Different numbers of electron pairs result in different shapes.

Hydrogen bonding in DNA
The double helix structure of DNA (Figure 5) is held together
by hydrogen bonds which enable a single DNA strand to
create a perfect copy of itself in a process called replication.
The replication process depends on four bases adenine A,
thymine T, cytosine C, and guanine G being present in the
correct order.
In Figure 5, you can see that:
A and T pair by forming two hydrogen bonds
Cand G pair by forming three hydrogen bonds
So why do the bases always pair up correctly?
The chemical structure and shape of these four bases
ensure correct pairing.
Adenine and guanine are both purine bases with two-
ringed structures.
Thymine and cytosine are both pyrimidine bases with
single-ringed structures.
Hydrogen bonding in the double helix can only take
place between a purine and a pyrimidine base.
The bases must fit together so that a hydrogen atom
from one molecule and an electronegative atom
(either oxygen or nitrogen) from the other molecule
are aligned correctly to maximize hydrogen bonding.
Figure 6 shows the pairing of A with T and C with G.
Figure 5 Hydrogen bonds in DNA hold the double helix
structure together and enable DNA to replicate by ensuring
that the correct bases are paired.
1 Suggest why pairing does not take place between
two purine bases or between two pyrimidine bases.

base pairs in a definite sequence. During replication,

Fluorine molecules are non-polar and only have London forces
between molecules.
Hydrogen chloride molecules are polar and have London forces
and permanent dipole-dipole interactions between molecules.
Extra energy is needed to break the additional permanent
dipole-dipole interactions between hydrogen chloride molecules.
The boiling point of hydrogen chloride is therefore higher than
fluorine.

Simple molecular substances
A simple molecular substance is made up of simple molecules -
small units containing a definite number of atoms with a definite
molecular formula, such as neon, Ne, hydrogen, H,, water, H, O, and
carbon dioxide, CO2
In the solid state, simple molecules form a regular structure called
a simple molecular lattice. In the simple molecular lattice:
strong covalent bonds between atoms in
12 molecule do not break on changing state
the molecules are held in place by weak intermolecular forces
the atoms within each molecule are bonded together strongly
by covalent bonds.
Figure 3 shows the different forces in the simple molecular lattice of
iodine, I
Properties of simple molecular substances
Low melting point and boiling point
All simple molecular substances are covalently bonded. At room
temperature, they may exist as solids, liquids, or gases. All simple
molecular substances can be solidified into simple molecular lattices
by reducing the temperature.
In a simple molecular lattice, the weak intermolecular forces can
be broken even by the energy present at low temperatures.
Simple molecular substances have low melting and
boiling points.
When a simple molecular lattice is broken apart during melting,
• only the weak intermolecular forces break
the covalent bonds are strong and do not break.
Solubility
Covalent substances with simple molecular structures fall into two
categories - polar and non-polar.
The solubility of non-polar substances is easier to predict.

temperature, but can easily be turned into

Demonstrate knowledge,

Electronegativity
In a covalent bond, the nuclei of the bonded atoms attract the shared
pair of electrons. In molecules of elements, such as hydrogen, H.,
oxygen, O, nitrogen, N, and chlorine, Cly, the atoms are the same
element and the bonded electron pair is shared evenly.
This changes when the bonded atoms are different elements:
• the nuclear charges are different
• the atoms may be different sizes
the shared pair of electrons may be closer to one nucleus than the
other.

attraction
The shared pair of electrons in the covalent bond may now experience
more attraction from one of the bonded atoms than the other.

fluorine is the most electronegative atom and is given a
Pauling value of 4.0. The noble gases are not included as
they tend not to form compounds.
The non-metals nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine have the

6.3 Intermolecular forces
Solubility of non-polar simple molecular substances
When a simple molecular compound is added to a non-polar
solvent, such as hexane, intermolecular forces form between the
molecules and the solvent.
The interactions weaken the intermolecular forces in the simple
molecular lattice. The intermolecular forces break and the
compound dissolves.
Therefore, non-polar simple molecular substances tend to be soluble in
non-polar solvents.
When a simple molecular substance is added to a polar solvent,
there is little interaction between the molecules in the lattice and
the solvent molecules.
• The intermolecular bonding within the polar solvent is too strong
to be broken.
Therefore simple molecular substances tend to be insoluble in
polar solvents.
Figure 4 compares the solubility of iodine in water (polar solvent) and
in cyclohexane (non-polar solvent).

compounds:
a have low melting and boiling

b do not usually dissolve

c have poor electrical

Solubility of polar simple molecular substances
Polar covalent substances may dissolve in polar solvents as the polar
solute molecules and the polar solvent molecules can attract each
other. The process is similar to dissolving of an ionic compound. For
example, sugar dissolves in water, a polar solvent. Sugar is a polar
covalent compound with many polar 0-H bonds, which attract and
bond with polar water molecules. This solubility can extend to liquids
and gases. Hydrogen chloride is a gas with a polar H-Cl bond that is
extremely soluble in water, forming hydrochloric acid.
The solubility depends on the strength of the dipole and can be hard
to predict. Some compounds such as ethanol, C,H,OH, contain both
polar (the 0-H) and non-polar (the carbon chain) parts in their
structure and can dissolve in both polar and non-polar solvents.
Some biological molecules have hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts.
The hydrophilic part will be polar and contain electronegative atoms
(usually oxygen) that can interact with water. The hydrophobic part
will be non-polar and comprised of a carbon chain.

6.4 Hydrogen bonding
Water has a relatively high melting point and boiling point
As with all molecules, water has London forces between molecules.
--
Hydrogen bonds are extra forces, over and above the London forces.
An appreciable quantity of energy is needed to break the hydrogen
bonds in water, so water has much higher melting and boiling
points than would be expected from just London forces.
When the ice lattice breaks, the rigid arrangement of hydrogen
bonds in ice is broken. When water boils, the hydrogen bonds
break completely.

would be no liquid water in most places on Earth and there would be no

to many more unusual properties of water. Other examples are a
relatively high surface tension and viscosity, properties than result in
droplets that are 'not wet' and allow insects to walk on pond surfaces.
Detergents reduce the surface tension, making water 'wetter'. Water
has dozens of anomalous properties, so you can be relieved that you are
only required to know about density, melting points, and boiling points.

6.4 Hydrogen bonding
Specification reference: 2.2.2
Hydrogen bonds
A hydrogen bond is a special type of permanent dipole-dipole
interaction found between molecules containing:
an electronegative atom with a lone pair of electrons, for example,
oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine
a hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom, for example,
H-O, H-N, or H-F.

The hydrogen bond acts between a lone pair of electrons on an
electronegative atom in one molecule and a hydrogen atom in
a different molecule. Hydrogen bonds are the strongest type of
intermolecular attractions.

Anomalous properties of water
Hydrogen bonding has a significant influence on the properties of
many molecules but none more so than water. Hydrogen bonding
gives water some unique and anomalous (unusual) properties that
support the existence of life on Earth.

Study tip
The solid (ice) is less dense than the liquid (water)
• Hydrogen bonds hold water molecules apart in an open
lattice structure.
The water molecules in ice are further apart than in water.
• Solid ice is less dense than liquid water and floats.
When you draw a diagram to show
hydrogen bonding, remember
to show lone pairs and the atom
polarities. Hydrogen is always 8+!
Ice floating on water may seem obvious, but water is one of the
few substances in which the solid is less dense than water. The
consequence is that ice floats instead of sinking in ponds and lakes,
forming an insulating layer and preventing the water from freezing
solid - good news if you are a fish. With two lone pairs on the oxygen
atom and two hydrogen atoms, each water molecule can form four
hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonds extend outwards, holding
water molecules slightly apart and forming an open tetrahedral
lattice full of holes (Figure 3). The bond angle about the hydrogen
atom involved in the hydrogen bond is close to 180°.
The holes in the open lattice structure decrease the density of water
on freezing. When ice melts, the ice lattice collapses and the molecules
move closer together. So liquid water is denser than solid ice.

0.917 g cm-" compared to 1.029gcm-3
for seawater. Only about of the volume
of the iceberg is above the surface of the

Bond polarity
Non-polar bonds
In a non-polar bond, the bonded electron pair is shared equally
between the bonded atoms. A bond will be non-polar when:
HXH
CI X Ci
the bonded atoms are the same, or
• the bonded atoms have the same or similar electronegativity.
In molecules of elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, the
bonded atoms come from the same element and the electron pair is
shared equally. The bond is a pure covalent bond (Figure 3). Carbon
and hydrogen atoms have very similar electronegativities and form
non-polar bonds. Hydrocarbon liquids such as hexane, CH4, are
non-polar solvents and do not mix with water.

Polar bonds
In a polar bond, the bonded electron pair is shared unequally between
the bonded atoms. A bond will be polar when the bonded atoms are
different and have different electronegativity values, resulting in a
polar covalent bond.
Example: Hydrogen chloride
Hydrogen chloride, HCl, has atoms of different elements.
From Figure 2, hydrogen has an electronegativity of 2.1 and
chlorine has an electronegativity of 3.0.
The chlorine atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atom.
The chlorine atom has a greater attraction for the bonded pair of
electrons than the hydrogen atom, resulting in a polar covalent bond.

The H-Cl bond is polarised with a small partial positive charge (8+)
on the hydrogen atom and a small partial negative charge (8-) on
the chlorine atom (Figure 4). The delta d sign means small. The two
charges, d+ and 8- are partial charges, and are much smaller than a
full + and - charge.
Study tip
If you are provided with Pauling
electronegativity values:
This separation of opposite charges is called a dipole.

at different ends of the H-Cl bond.

electronegativity value has
the o-charge
the atom with the smaller
electronegativity value has
the d+ charge.
A dipole in a polar covalent bond does not change and is called a
permanent dipole to distinguish it from an induced dipole, which
you will meet in the next topic.
Polar molecules
Hydrogen chloride is a polar molecule, as the H-Cl bond has one
permanent dipole acting in the direction of the H-Cl bond. For
molecules with more than two atoms, there may be two or more
polar bonds. Depending on the shape of the molecule, the dipoles
may reinforce one another to produce a larger dipole over the whole
molecule, or cancel out if the dipoles act in opposite directions.
6.3 Intermolecular forces
Specification reference: 2.2.2
Forces between molecules
Covalent bonding is strong and holds the atoms in a molecule together.
Intermolecular forces are weak interactions between dipoles of
different molecules. Intermolecular forces fall into three main categories.
induced dipole-dipole interactions (London forces)
permanent dipole-dipole interactions
• hydrogen bonding.
Intermolecular forces are largely responsible for physical properties
such as melting and boiling points, whereas covalent bonds determine
the identity and chemical reactions of molecules.
Table 1 compares the strengths of intermolecular forces with
covalent bonds.

Induced dipole-dipole interactions (London forces)
London forces are weak intermolecular forces that exist between all
molecules, whether polar or non-polar. They act between induced
dipoles in different molecules. The origin of induced dipoles is
described in Figure 1.

The strength of induced dipole-dipole interactions
(London forces)
Induced dipoles result from interactions of electrons between
molecules. The more electrons in each molecule:
• the larger the instantaneous and induced dipoles
the greater the induced dipole-dipole interactions
• the stronger the attractive forces between molecules.
Table 2 compares the boiling points of the first three noble gases, helium
to argon.
Larger numbers of electrons mean larger induced dipoles.
More energy is then needed to overcome the intermolecular
forces, increasing the boiling point.

What ever happened to van der Waals' forces?
The term van der Waals, forces has sometimes been used to describe
induced dipole-dipole interactions. The International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), which publishes guidelines for
chemical terminology, recommends that van der Waals' forces be
used for both permanent and induced dipole-dipole interactions, and
London forces for induced dipole-dipole interactions. So the term
van der Waals' forces is ambiguous.
London forces is the correct term to use when describing induced
dipole-dipole interactions. In other sources, you may see the
term dispersion forces. Whoever said the language of science is
straightforward?

In Topic 6.1, you looked at polarity in bonds and molecules.
Permanent dipole-dipole interactions act between the permanent
dipoles in different polar molecules.

chloride and fluorine should be very similar.
