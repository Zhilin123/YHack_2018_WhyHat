25.4 Directing groups
Making TNT
An application of directing groups can be seen in the reaction of methylbenzene
(toluene) with an excess of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acid.
At 50 °C, toluene (methylbenzene) forms a monosubstituted product,
2-nitrotoluene (Step 1 in Figure 6).
The product of this reaction is less reactive than toluene because the
-NO, group deactivates the benzene ring. However if the temperature
of the reaction mixture is increased to 70°C a disubstituted product,
2,4-dinitrotoluene is formed (Step 2 in Figure 6).
A Figure 5 TNT is best known now as
an explosive, but it was originally used
as a yellow dye. TNT only found use as
an explosive at the beginning of the
twentieth century, when it was used in
armour-piercing artillery shells
The second-NO, group deactivates the benzene ring further. Further
reaction will produce 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene - TNT (Step 3 in Figure 6).
However, this requires extreme conditions - a good job really as any
accidental over-heating could result in an explosion.

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS
Using directing effects in organic synthesis
The directing effect of substituent groups can be used when planning
an organic synthesis. When carrying out more than one electrophilic
substitution reaction on an aromatic compound, you may have to
consider the order in which the reactions are carried out to ensure the
correct substitution pattern and that the required product is prepared.
6 Worked example: Planning an organic synthesis
Suggest a series of reactions that
could be used to carry out the
following synthesis. You should be
able to carry out the reaction in
two steps.
Step 1: Identify the type of
disubstitution.
NO2
The required product is a 1,4-disubstituted product.
Therefore the first substituent added must direct to the 4 position.
Step 2: Identify the directing effect of the two substituents.
NO
2-directing
• NO, directs the
second substituent
to carbon 3.
Cl directs the
second substituent
to carbons 2 and 4.

Therefore Cl must be
substituted first to give
the correct direction
for the second NO, substituent.

synthesis.

As Cl directs to positions 2 and 4, a mixture of the required
4- substituted product and the 2- substituted product would be
obtained. These could be separated by distillation if they are liquids,
or other methods including recrystallisation, if they are solids.

Alkylation can be used to add
a carbon chain to the benzene
ring. This increases the number
of carbon atoms in the structure.
You will learn other methods of
increasing the length of a carbon
chain in Topic 28.1, Carbon-carbon
bond formation.
Alkylation reactions
The alkylation of benzene is the substitution of a hydrogen atom in
the benzene ring by an alkyl group. The reaction is carried out by
reacting benzene with a haloalkane in the presence of AICI,, which
acts as a halogen carrier catalyst, generating the electrophile.
Alkylation increases the number of carbon atoms in a compound by
forming carbon-carbon bonds.
The reaction is sometimes called a Friedel-Crafts alkylation after the
two chemists who first carried out the reaction. An example of a
Friedel-Crafts alkylation is shown in Figure 9.

Phenols are a type of organic chemical containing a hydroxyl, -OH,
functional group directly bonded to an aromatic ring. The simplest
member of the phenols, C,H,OH, has the same name as the group -
phenol. In this topic you will study some of the reactions of phenol
but any compound that contains an -OH group attached directly to the

bonded to a carbon side chain, rather than the aromatic ring. These
compounds are classified as alcohols rather than phenols.

Although alcohols and phenols have some common reactions,

with benzene. Phenol is nitrated with dilute nitric acid rather than
needing concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids as with benzene.

Nitrobenzene is an important starting material in the preparation
of dyes, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. It can be used as a starting
material in the preparation of paracetamol (Figure 4).
The reaction mechanism for the nitration of benzene, electrophilic
substitution, is shown in Figure 5.
The reaction involves an electrophile. However, nitric acid is not
the electrophile involved in the mechanism. The electrophile in this
reaction is the nitronium ion, NO,, produced by the reaction of
concentrated nitric acid with concentrated sulfuric acid (Step 1).
In the next step (Step 2) the electrophile, NO,, accepts a pair of
electrons from the benzene ring to form a dative covalent bond. The
organic intermediate formed is unstable and breaks down to form the
organic product, nitrobenzene, and the H+ ion. A stable benzene ring
is reformed.

Reactivity of benzene and its derivatives
Benzene and its derivatives undergo substitution reactions in which
a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring is replaced by another atom or
group of atoms. Benzene typically reacts with electrophiles and most of
the reactions of benzene proceed by electrophilic substitution.

Nitration of benzene
Benzene reacts slowly with nitric acid to form nitrobenzene (Figure 2).
The reaction is catalysed by sulfuric acid and heated to 50°C to obtain
a good rate of reaction. A water bath is used to maintain the steady
temperature.
Study tip
In nitration, one of the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring is
replaced by a nitro, -NO2, group.

This reaction has a 95% yield of phenol from benzene. Nitrous oxide is a
gaseous waste product from the production of nylon and cannot be allowed
to escape into the atmosphere, as it is a greenhouse gas.

Phenol as a weak acid
Phenol is less soluble in water than alcohols due to the presence
of the non-polar benzene ring. When dissolved in water, phenol
partially dissociates forming the phenoxide ion and a proton
(Figure 3). Because of this ability to partially dissociate to produce
protons, phenol is classified as a weak acid. Similarly, other phenols
act as weak acids.

H+
Phenol is more acidic than alcohols but less acidic than carboxylic
acids. This can be seen by comparing the acid dissociation constant K
of an alcohol with a phenol and a carboxylic acid (Table 1).

• Ethanol does not react with sodium hydroxide (a strong base) or

Phenols and carboxylic acids react with solutions of strong bases
such as aqueous sodium hydroxide.
Only carboxylic acids are strong enough acids to react with the
weak base, sodium carbonate.
A reaction with sodium carbonate can be used to distinguish between
a phenol and a carboxylic acid - the carboxylic acid reacts with sodium
carbonate to produce carbon dioxide, which is evolved as a gas.

a structure containing many double bonds or a structure containing
double and triple bonds. Compounds containing multiple bonds were
known to be very reactive, however benzene appeared unreactive.
The Kekulé model
In 1865, the German chemist Friedrich August Kekulé suggested that
the structure of benzene was based on a six membered ring of carbon
atoms joined by alternate single and double bonds (Figure 3). He
claimed that he had thought of the ring shape of benzene whilst
day-dreaming about a snake seizing its own tail.
Evidence to disprove Kekulé's model
Not all chemists accepted the Kekulé model of benzene as the
structure is not able to explain all of its chemical and physical
properties. This section outlines three pieces of evidence which appear
to disprove Kekulé's model.

structures of Kekulé's benzene
1 The lack of reactivity of benzene
If benzene contained the C=C bonds shown in Figure 3, it should
decolourise bromine in an electrophilic addition reaction. However:

• benzene does not undergo electrophilic addition reactions
benzene does not decolourise bromine under normal conditions.
This has led scientists to suggest that benzene cannot have any C=C
bonds in its structure.

Topic 13.3, Reactions of alkenes,
and Topic 13.4, Electrophilic
addition in alkenes.
2 The lengths of the carbon-carbon bonds in benzene
Using a technique called X-ray diffraction, it is possible to measure bond
lengths in a molecule. When benzene was examined in 1929 by the
crystallographer Kathleen Lonsdale, it was found that all the bonds in
benzene were 0.139 nm in length. This bond length was between the
length of a single bond, 0.153 nm, and a double bond, 0.134nm.
3 Hydrogenation enthalpies
The Kekulé structure, containing alternate single and double bonds,
could be given the name cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene to indicate the
positioning of the double bonds.
If benzene did have the Kekulé structure, then it would be expected to
have an enthalpy change of hydrogenation that is three times that of
cyclohexene. When cyclohexene is hydrogenated (Figure 4) one double
bond reacts with hydrogen. The enthalpy change of hydrogenation is
-120kJ mol-1.

to the addition of hydrogen to an

The delocalised model of Benzene
The delocalised model of benzene was developed by scientists who

Benzene is a planar, cyclic, hexagonal hydrocarbon containing six
carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms.
Each carbon atom uses three of its available four electrons in
bonding to two other carbon atoms and to one hydrogen atom.
Each carbon atom has one electron in a p-orbital at right angles to
the plane of the bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms.
Adjacent p-orbital electrons overlap sideways, in both directions,
above and below the plane of the carbon atoms to form a ring of
electron density.
This overlapping of the p-orbitals creates a system of tt-bonds
(pi-bonds) which spread over all six of the carbon atoms in the
ring structure.
The six electrons occupying this system of t-bonds (pi-bonds) are
said to be delocalised.

found in cigarette smoke
classified as a carcinogen, that is, it can cause cancer.
A benzene molecule consists of a hexagonal ring of six carbon atoms,
with each carbon atom joined to two other carbon atoms and to one
hydrogen atom. Benzene is classed as an aromatic hydrocarbon or
arene. The structure of benzene is shown in two ways (Figure 1).
You may think that benzene, with a name resembling an alkene, would
react in the same way as the alkenes. However this is not the case.

Derivatives of benzene
Historically, aromatic was the term used to classify the derivatives of
benzene, as many pleasant-smelling compounds contained a benzene
ring. Many odourless compounds have been found to contain a benzene
ring, yet the term aromatic is still used to classify these compounds.

Further substitution
Phenol can undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with nitric
acid to form two isomers, 2-nitrophenol and 4-nitrophenol (Topic 253,
The chemistry of phenol). Like phenol, many substituted aromatic
compounds can undergo a second substitution - disubstitution. Some
of these reactions take place more readily than benzene itself whereas
other reactions take place less easily and require extreme conditions.

increased. The increased electron density attracts electrophiles more
strongly than with benzene.
The aromatic ring in phenol is therefore more susceptible to attack
from electrophiles than in benzene. For bromine, the electron density
in the phenol ring structure is sufficient to polarise bromine molecules
and so no halogen carrier catalyst is required.
