ACIDS, BASES, AND PH
You know this fact already, but the very reason that neutral water has
a pH of 7 is the K value of 1.00 x 10-14 mol² dm-6.

What about solutions of acids and alkalis?
The ionic product of water K is essentially an equilibrium constant
that controls the concentrations of H+ (aq) and OH-(aq) in aqueous
solutions.
In any aqueous solution, there will always be both H(aq) and
OH (aq) ions present such that [H+(aq)] [OH-(aq)] = K.
A solution is acidic when [H+(aq)] > [OH-(aq)]
A solution is neutral when [H+(aq)] = [OH-(aq)]
A solution is alkaline when [H+(aq)] < [OH-(aq)]
So a solution that is acidic still contains OH-(aq) ions, it is just that
there are more H(aq) ions (and vice versa for an alkaline solution).
The value of K 1.00 x 10-14 mol2 dm6 at 298 K (25 °C), controls the
concentrations of H(aq) and OH(aq).
Figure 2 ApH meter measuring
the pH of rainwater. Pure (distilled and
deionised) water is considered neutral
at pH 7 There are several reasons why
water may deviate from pH 7, including
the presence of dissolved salts and
gases. Rainwater tends to have a pH
somewhere in the range 5-6 (the
sample here has a pH of 5.48)
For pH values that are whole numbers, it is easy to work out the
H(aq) and OH(aq) concentrations as the indices for [H(aq)] and
[OH-(aq)] add up to -14.
In an acid solution with a pH of 3:
[H+(aq)] = 10-'mol dm3
[OH-(aq)] = 10-11 mol dm-3
If the pH value is not a whole number, you will need to do a little
more work as in the worked example below.
Study tip
For [H+(aq)] = 10-3 mol dm-3
[OH(aq)] = 10-11 mol dm-
(-3) + (-11)=-14
6 Worked example: Calculating [H+(aq)] and [OH-(aq)]
in aqueous solutions 1
What are the concentrations of H(aq) and OH-(aq) ions in a
solution with a pH of 3.25 at 25°C?
Step 1: Use your calculator to find [H+ (aq)].
[H+ (aq)] = 10-pH = 10-3.25 = 5,62 x 104 mol dm-
Step 2: Calculate [OH-(aq)] from K, and [H+ (aq)].
K = [H+ (aq)] [OH-(aq)] = 1.00 x 10-14
[OH(aq) =—KW - 1.00 x 10-14
[H+(aq)] 5.62 x 10-4
= 1.78 x 10-11 mol dm-3

K is the key to working out
[H+(aq)] and [OH-(aq)].

Worked example: Calculating [H+ (aq)] and [OH- (aq)]
in aqueous solutions 2
What is the pH of a solution with [OH- (aq)] = 2.00 x 10-2 mol dm-
at 25°C?
Step 1: Calculate [H+ (aq)] from K, and [OH-(aq)].
K = [H+ (aq)] [OH-(aq)] = 1.00 x 10-14
_ KW
[H+ (aq)] =
1.00 x 10-14
[OH- (aq)] 2.00 x 10-2
= 5.00 x 10-13 mol dm-
Step 2: Use your calculator to find pH.
pH = -log[H+ (aq)] = -log(5.00 x 10-B) = 12.30

Acids, bases, and neutralisation.
The pH of solutions of strong bases
An alkali is a soluble base that releases OH-ions in aqueous solution.
A strong base is an alkali that completely dissociates in solution. For
example, sodium hydroxide, NaOH, is a strong alkali and completely
dissociates:
NaOH(aq) Nat(aq) + OH-(aq)
Imol
I mol
NaOH is a monobasic base as each mole of NaOH releases one mole of
OH(aq) ions.
The pH of a strong base can be calculated from:
• the concentration of the base
• the ionic product of water K
O Worked example: Calculating the pH of a solution of
a strong base
A solution of NaOH has a concentration of 0.0750 moldm".
What is the pH at 25°C?
Study tip
Each mole of a dibasic base, such
as Ca(OH), releases two moles of
OH-ions.
Ca(OH)2(aq) Ca2+ (aq) + 2OH- (aq)
1 mol
2 mol
So in a pH calculation:
[OH-(aq)] = 2 x [Ca(OH), (aq)]
Step 1: Convert [NaOH(aq)] into [OH-(aq)].
NaOH is a strong monobasic alkali and completely
dissociates.
TOH(aq)] = [NaOH(aq)] = 0.0750 moldm-3
Step 2: Use K, and [OH-(aq)] to find [H+ (aq)].
Kw = [H+ (aq)] [OH(aq)] = 1.00 10-14 moldm
K 1.00 x 10-14
Ha] 5 TOH-(aq)]
-= 1.33 x 10-13 moldm-3

20.2 The pH scale and strong acids
Step 2: Find the pH values before and after dilution.
HCl is a strong acid and completely dissociates:
[H+ (aq)] = [HCl(aq)]
Before dilution, [H+(aq)] = 0.100
pH = -log(0.100) = 1.00
After dilution, [H(aq)] = 0.0500
pH = -log(0.0500) = 1.30
Changing the concentration by a factor of 2 changes the
pH by 0.30.

What about weak bases?
As with strong bases, a weak base is also an alkali. Ammonia gas is
an example of a weak base - it dissolves in water releasing OH-ions
from water molecules. An equilibrium is set up with the equilibrium
positioned well to the left.
Calculation of the pH of weak bases
goes beyond the scope of this
Chemistry course
NH,(aq) + H2O(l) = NH,*(aq) + OH(aq)
So one mole of NH, releases far less than one mole of OH(aq) ions.
The pH of weak bases can be calculated using a similar method to that
used for weak acids.
pOH
POH is a similar scale to pH, used as a convenient way of
showing OHconcentrations, [OH(aq)]:
pOH = -log[OH (aq)] [OH- (aq)] = 10 -POH
The pOH scale has a similar range to pH, centred at the
neutral point where (H+(aq)] and [OH-(aq)] are both equal to
10-7 moldm-3. The pH and pOH scales are shown in Table 1.
What is the pH of a solution with
[OH(aq)] = 4.50 10-3 mol dm-3 at 25°C?
Step 1: Calculate pOH from [OH (aq)].
pOH = -log[OH- (aq)]=-log(4.50 x 10-3)
= 2.34

You first met strong and weak
acids in Topic 4.1, Acids, bases, and
neutralisation.
.
6) Worked example: Calculating pH from acid
concentration
A sample of nitric acid has a concentration of 1.35 x 10-2 moldm
What is the pH?
Step 1: Convert [HA(aq)] into [H+ (aq)].
HNO, is a strong acid and completely dissociates.
[H+ (aq)] = [HNO3(aq)] = 1.35 x 10-2 mol dm3
Step 2: Use your calculator to find the pH.
pH = -log[H+(aq)] = -log(1.35 x 10-2) = 1.87
Study tip
If the acid is strong, you can use
the simple method here. For weak
acids, there is another important
step. See Topic 20.4, The pH of
weak acids, for details.
3) Worked example: Calculating acid concentration
from pH
A sample of hydrochloric acid has a pH of 3.79.
What is the concentration of the hydrochloric acid?
Step 1: Use your calculator to find [H+(aq)].
TH(aq)] = 10-pH = 10-3.79 = 1.62 x 10-4 mol dm-3
Study tip
The whole number before a
decimal place is the logarithmic
way for showing powers of 10.
Significant figures for pH values
starts after the decimal place. So
a pH of 2.66 is to two significant
figures only. So don't round pH
values to one decimal place as
this is only one significant figure.
As a general rule, show pH values
to two decimal places unless you
are asked for a different number of
places. This reflects the accuracy
of most pH meters.
Step 2: Convert [H+ (aq)] into [HA (aq)].
HCl is a strong acid and completely dissociates.
[HCl(aq)] = [H+ (aq)] = 1.62 x 10-4 mol dm-
pH changes on dilution
A pH of 1 has 10 times the concentration of H+(aq) ions as a solution
with a pH of 2. The next worked example shows that diluting by half
changes the pH by just 0.30.
E pH on dilution
50 cm of 0.100 moldm- hydrochloric acid is diluted to 100 cm
with water. What is the change in pH?

20.1 Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases
Reactions between acids and bases
Neutralisation of acids with carbonates
Carbonates are bases that neutralise acids to form a salt, water, and
carbon dioxide.
acid + carbonate + salt + water + carbon dioxide
Study tip
For a solid, you still write the ionic
equation with the full formula
of the carbonate because the
carbonate changes state during
the reaction.
Solid copper(II) carbonate reacts with any acid as follows:
2H+ (aq) + CuCO3(s) → Cu2+(aq) + H2O(1) + CO2(g)
In aqueous solutions of carbonates spectator ions cancel and the final
equation is simpler, for example, with aqueous sodium carbonate:
2H+(aq) + 2Na+(aq) + CO2-(aq) + 2Nataq) + H,O(1) + CO, (g)
2H+ (aq) + CO,-(aq) → H2O(l) + CO2(g)
Neutralisation of acids with metal oxides
An acid is neutralised by a solid metal oxide or hydroxide to form a
salt and water only.
acid + base
salt + water
For magnesium oxide the reaction with any acid is:
2H+ (aq) + MgO(s) + Mg2+ (aq) + H2O(1)
Neutralisation of acids with alkalis
With alkalis, the acid and base are in solution. The overall reaction is
the same as for metal oxides:
Study tip
acid + alkali
salt + water
Full and ionic equations for acids are
much more difficult to write than
they look. Practise writing equations
from scratch for carbonates and
bases.
The ionic equation, shown below, is much simpler than the full
equation - neutralisation of H+(aq) ions by OH-(aq) ions to form
neutral water, H,O(l):

pk, values are much more manageable than K, and it is much easier
to compare relative acidic strengths using pK, values than K, values.

What is the pK value of a weak acid with a K value of
1.48 x 10-4 mol dm ??
PK, = -log K
PK, = -log(1.48 x 10-4)
You should get 3.83 (to two decimal places).
o Worked example: Converting from pk tok
What is the K, value of a weak acid with a pK, of 4.82?
K = 10-pka
[H+ (aq)] = 10-4,82

Weak acids in wine
Sulfurous acid
Wines often contain traces of sulfurous acid, H,SO,
added as a preservative. Sulfurous acid is a dibasic acid
and its dissociation is shown below.
pk = 1.92
HS0z (aq)=H+ (aq) + S0,2-(aq) pk = 2.18
For the first dissociation, H, SO, acts as a weak acid.
From the pk values, the weak acid, HSO,, in the second
dissociation is a far weaker acid than H,SOZ.
This behaviour is typical for dibasic and tribasic acids.

20.3 The acid dissociation
constant K
Specification reference: 5.1.3
Strong and weak acids
Strong and weak are terms used to describe the extent of dissociation
of an acid. A strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, HCl, completely
dissociates in aqueous solution.
HCl(aq) → H*(aq) + Cl(aq)
A weak acid, such as ethanoic acid, CH,COOH, partially dissociates.
CH,COOH(aq) = H+ (aq) + CH,COO-(aq)
In this topic you will learn about the extent of dissociation of weak
acids in terms of an equilibrium constant.

The dissociation of any weak acid, HA, can be shown as a general form:
Synoptic link
HA(aq) = H(aq) + A-(aq).
For more details of equilibrium
constants, see Chapter 19,
Equilibrium.
The acid dissociation constant, K is calculated as:
K - [H+(aq)] [A (aq)] unite. (moldm-) (moldm?)
moldm-3
[HA(aq)]
(moldm)
Using this principle, you can write the K expression for any weak
acid. For ethanoic acid:
K - [H+(aq)] [CH, COO (aq)]
[CH3COOH(aq)]
As with all equilibrium constants, K, changes with temperature and
recorded K values are usually standardised at 25°C. The larger the
numerical value of K , the further the equilibrium is to the right. If
you look at the K expression, the concentration of the dissociated ions
are on top and so the larger the K, value, the greater the dissociation
and the greater the acid strength.
Study tip
K is simply K applied to the
dissociation of an acid.
As the terms are always the
same as the general form of
[H+(aq)] [A (aq)], the units are
[HA(aq)]
always mol dm-
K and pk
The K, values highlight a potential problem that you have already
seen with [H+(aq)] - it is difficult to compare numbers with negative
indices. As with the pH scale, the problem has been solved by
converting the K value into a negative logarithm called PK.
PK = -logK
The reverse of this relationship is:
K = 10-pka

The role of H+ in the reactions of acids
Acids react with metals, carbonates, metal oxides, and alkalis to form
salts. The active species from the acid is H+(aq) and ionic equations can
be written for each type of reaction to emphasise the role of H+ ions.
Synoptic link
Look back at Chapter 4, Acid and
redox, to revise these reactions.
When writing ionic equations with H(aq), the acid does not matter -
it is the same reaction. For example, the equations below are for
reaction of magnesium with dilute hydrochloric and sulfuric acids:
Reaction with HCl(aq)
full equation:
cancel spectator ions:
ionic equation:
2HCl(aq) + Mg(s) — MgCl, (aq) + H2(g)
2H+ (aq) + 2€Haq) + Mg(s) → Mg2+ (aq) + 26Haq) + H2
2H+ (aq) + Mg(s) → Mg2+ (aq) + H2(g)
Reaction with H2SO4(aq)
full equation:
cancel spectator ions:
ionic equation:
H,80,(aq) + Mg(s) + MgSO4(aq) + H2(g)
2H+ (aq) + SO49) + Mg(s) → Mg2+ (aq) + 50,-aq) + H,
2H+ (aq) + Mg(s) → Mg2+ (aq) + H2(g)
The ionic equation for the reaction of magnesium with dilute
hydrochloric acid and dilute sulfuric acid is the same.
Study tip
Spectator ions are ions that do not change during the reaction. In the
equations, spectator ions can simply be cancelled out. You then know
that any acid will react with magnesium to form Mg2+ (aq) ions and
hydrogen gas. All the ionic equations in the next section use H+ (aq)
only for the acid.
Spectator ions are the spectators
of chemical reactions. They do
not themselves react during the
reaction.

Redox reactions between acids and metals
Dilute acids undergo redox reactions with some metals to produce
salts and hydrogen gas.

A few acids, such as nitric acid,
are also strong oxidising agents.
Except when it is very dilute, nitric
acid reacts differently with most
metals.
For zinc, the ionic equation for a reaction with any dilute acid is:

20.2 The pH scale and strong acids
Specification reference: 5.1.3
The pH scale
Søren Sørensen, the founder of pH
Many of the things used on a daily basis, like tap water, food, drinks,
cosmetics, and medicines, are routinely tested for pH. Just over
100 years ago, the Danish chemist Søren Sørensen introduced pH as a
simple numerical scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentrations.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
→ the pH scale
→ converting between pH and
[H*(aq)]
calculating the pH of a strong
monobasic acid.
Sørensen found that hydrogen ion concentrations in solutions had
a very large range of values with negative powers of 10. Sørensen
used the negative logarithm of these hydrogen ion concentrations to
produce a more manageable scale. Using Sørensen's scale, hydrogen
ion concentrations of 10-1 to 10-14 are converted to pH values of 1 to
14 (Table 1). The strength of Sørensen's pH scale is its simplicity and
ease of use. For any solution at 25°C:

10º = 1
pH less than 7 shows decreasing acidity
pH greater than 7 shows increasing alkalinity
pH 7 is neutral.
Before Sørensen's pH scale, the degree of acidity and basicity in
solutions was measured as colours using indicators – Sørensen added
numbers to the colours. Sørensen's method relied on measuring
hydrogen ion using an electrochemical cell. Nowadays, pH meters
are used for measuring pH accurately (Figure 1) and are based on the
same principle. pH indicator paper or universal indicator solution is
still used as an easier and cheaper, though less accurate, alternative.

pH - a logarithmic scale
The pH scale in Table 1 shows the relationship between pH and the
concentration of H+(aq).
A low value of [H(aq)] matches a high value of pH.
A high value of [H+(aq)] matches a low value of pH.
The mathematical relationship between pH and [H(aq)] is:
pH = -log[H+(aq)]
The reverse of this relationship is:

[H(aq)] = 10-PH
As a logarithmic scale, a
change of one pH number is
equal to a 10 times difference
in [H+(aq)]. So there is a
large difference in hydrogen
ion concentration between
solutions with a pH of 2 and a
pH of 3.

weakly alkaline pH of 9.11 for the
solution in the container. The probe of
the pH meter, dipped in the solution,

the electrical potential of the hydrogen
ions. This is directly related to the pH

20.2 The pH scale and strong acids
A pH of 1 has 10 times the concentration of H+ ions as a solution
with a pH of 2.
To dilute a solution from a pH l to a pH of 4 (just 3 pH units)
would require dilution by 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000 times.
A solution with a pH of 1 contains 1013 times more H+(aq) ions as
a solution with a pH of 14.
Comparing 1 with 14 is a lot more manageable than comparing
1x 10-1 with 1 x 10-14.
Converting between pH and [H+(aq)]
You need to be able to convert pH into [H+ (aq)] and vice versa.
Study tip
You need to to learn the two
equations linking pH with [H+(aq)]
as you will use both many times.
2) Worked example: Converting from [H+(aq)] to pH
What is the pH of a solution with a H+(aq) concentration of
2.45 x 10-'moldm-??
pH = -log [H+ (aq)]
pH = -log(2.45 x 10-3)
You should get 2.61 (to two decimal places).
Study tip
Check your answers for both
worked examples. Are they
sensible? The (H+(aq)] should
have a negative power of 10 within
one of the pH values.

Calculating the pH of strong acids
In aqueous solution, a strong monobasic acid, HA, completely dissociates:
Figure 1 The log button and the 10%
function above the log button
HA(aq) + H+(aq) + A (aq)
I mol
I mol
So, for a strong acid, [H+(aq)] is equal to the concentration of the acid,
[HA(aq)]:
Study tip
Practise with any pH of a [H+(aq)]
value. Then try to go back again
using pH = -log[H*(aq)].
Repeat until you are comfortable
converting between pH and
[H(aq)] and get used to the
buttons on your calculator.
[H(aq)] = [HA (aq)]
The pH of a strong acid can be calculated directly from the concentration
of the acid.

The pH of weak acids
For a monobasic acid, HA, in aqueous solution:
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
→ calculations of pH and K for

► the limitations of pH and K
calculations for weak acids.
a strong acid HA completely dissociates: [H*(aq)] = [HA(aq)]
a weak acid HA partially dissociates: [H+(aq)] = [HA(aq)]
For a weak acid there is an equilibrium:
HA(aq) = H+(aq) + A (aq)
[H*(aq)] depends upon:
the concentration of the acid, [HA(aq)]
• the acid dissociation constant K.
When HA molecules dissociate, H(aq) and A-(aq) ions are formed in
equal quantities. The start and equilibrium concentrations of HA(aq),
H*(aq), and A (aq) are shown in Figure 1.

Approximations
The equation above can be greatly simplified by making two
approximations.
Study tip
For a weak acid with a value of
1x 10-?, only 1 molecule in every
1000 dissociates.
Soat equilibrium, there are
still 999 molecules of the
undissociated weak acid present.
999 - 1000, only a 0.1% difference.
For a value of 1 x 10-4, the
approximation is even better:
9999 - 10000
Approximation 1
From Figure 1, HA dissociates to produce equilibrium concentrations
of H+(aq) and A-(aq) that are equal. There will also be a very small
concentration of H+ (aq) from the dissociation of water but this will
be extremely small and can be neglected compared with the H+
concentration from the acid.
[H*(aq) Jeqn = [A (aq)]eqm
Approximation 2
From Figure 1, the equilibrium concentration of HA is smaller than
the undissociated concentration.
[HA(aq) legm = [HA (aq) Istarı - [H+ (aq) legm
As the dissociation of weak acids is small, you can assume that
[HA(aq)]stari >> [H+(aq)] and you can neglect any decrease in the
concentration of HA from dissociation.

The importance of K.
The significance of K, having a value of 1.00 x 10-14 mol2 dm 6 at
25°C is huge. The value sets up the neutral point in the pH scale.
The examples below all apply to 298K (25 °C). K controls the
concentration of H+(aq) and OH(aq) ions in aqueous solutions.
The pH of pure water at 25°C
On dissociation, water is neutral - it produces the same number of
H+(aq) and OH-(aq) ions.
So [H+ (aq)] = [OH-(aq)]
Kw = [H+ (aq)] [OH-(aq)] = [H+ (aq)] = 1.00 x 10-14 mol2 dm

20.1 Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases
For example, neutralisation of an acid by an alkali can be written
using H,O+(aq) or H+(aq):
Study tip
The simplified form H+ (aq) is
often used instead of H.0+(aq).
Just remember that H+ (aq) really
represents the hydronium ion,
H20*(aq).
H,O+(aq) + OH(aq) + 2H, 0(1)
H+ (aq) + OH-(aq) → H20(1)
Monobasic, dibasic, and tribasic acids
The terms monobasic, dibasic, and tribasic acids refer to the total
number of hydrogen ions in the acid that can be replaced per molecule
in an acid-base reaction. This would typically be replacement of
protons by metal ions or ammonium ions to form a salt.
Study tip
You may come across the terms
monoprotic, diprotic, and triprotic,
which are also used for monobasic,
dibasic, and tribasic.
The number of hydrogen atoms in the formula gives a clue for the
type of acid. Table 1 shows some common monobasic, dibasic, and
tribasic acids.

Write equations for the complete neutralisation of nitric acid,
sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid with an excess of NaOH(aq).
Step 1 Decide on whether an acid is monobasic, dibasic, or
tribasic by counting the number of hydrogen atoms in
the formula, not including organic carbon chains.
HNO, has one hydrogen atom, therefore it is monobasic.
HZS two hydrogen atoms, therefore it is dibasic.
H,PO, has three hydrogen atoms, therefore it is tribasic.
Step 2 Write the equation using as many NaOH units needed to
replace the hydrogen atoms in the acid.
HNO, has one replaceable H+ ion
HNO, (aq) + NaOH(aq) - NaNO3(aq) + H2O(1)
one H replaced

Neutralisation can be shown by a simple equation.

In hydrochloric acid, H+ ions have been supplied by dissociation:
HCl(aq) = H+ (aq) + Cl(aq)

Provided that two of [H+(aq)] (or pH), K and [HA(aq)] are known,

Calculating pH
To calculate pH using the K expression above, you first need to make
[H+(aq)] the subject of the equation:
[H+ (aq)] = K * [HA (aq)] [H+ (aq)] = /K[HA(aq)]
Study tip
The key to solving the pH of a weak
acid is the relationship:
[H*(aq)] = /K, (HA(aq)]
It is well worth memorising this
equation.
The worked example below shows how the pH of a weak acid can be
calculated from the acid concentration and K value.

[H+ (aq)] = VK, X[CH,COO(aq)] = 0.0245 x 1.7 x 10-5)
= 6.45 x 10-4 mol dm-3
Step 2: Use your calculator to find the pH.
pH = -log[H+(aq)] = -log (6.45 x 10-4) = 3.19
Study tip
Take care when using the calculator
for the square root. You must use
brackets around the values for
K [HA(aq)] or calculate K [HA(aq)]
first, and then take the square root
of the answer afterwards.
Determination of K
Experimentally the K for a weak acid can be determined by
preparing a standard solution of the weak acid of known
concentration
measuring the pH of the standard solution using a pH meter.
The worked example below shows how the K value of a weak acid
can be calculated from the acid concentration and a pH measurement.

20.4 The pH of weak acids
3 Worked example: Calculating K for a weak acid
The pH of 0.065 mol dm- propanoic acid, CH,CH,COOH, is 3.04.
Calculate K
Step 1: Use your calculator to find [H*(aq)].
TH+ (aq)] = 10-pH = 10-3.04 = 9.12 x 10-4 mol dm3
Step 2: Calculate K from [H+ (aq)] and [HA(aq)].
[H+ (aq)] [CH,CH,C00-(aq)] [H+(aq)12
[CH,CH,COOH(aq)] [CH,CH,COOH(aq)]
-= 1.28 x 10-5 mol dm-3
0.065
K - (9.12 x 10-4)2
Approximations in calculations involving weak acids
Both the worked examples make use of two approximations. Are these
justified? Are there any situations where the approximations break down?
Synoptic link
See Topic 20.5, pH and strong
bases, for details of the
dissociation of water.
Approximation 1
The first approximation assumes that the dissociation of water is negligible.
[H+ (aq) legm ~ [A (aq) Jeqm
At 25 °C, [H+(aq)] from dissociation of water = 10-7 moldm-?. If the
pH > 6, then [H+(aq)] from the dissociation of water will be significant
compared with dissociation of the weak acid. This approximation
breaks down for very weak acids or very dilute solutions.
Approximation 2
The second approximation assumes that the concentration of acid is
much greater than the H+ concentration at equilibrium:
[HA(aq)]start >> [H+ (aq)]egm
[HA (aq) em = [HA(aq) Istar - [H+ (aq)eom approximates to
[HA]eqm = [HA]start
This approximation will hold for weak acids with small K values.
It breaks down when [H+(aq)] becomes significant and there is a real
difference between [HA(aq)eam and [HA(aq)]start - [H+ (aq)legm
This approximation is not justified for stronger weak acids with
K > 10-2 moldm-” and for very dilute solutions.
Checking the approximations
You can carry out the weak acid pH calculation without making the
[HA(aq)]star - [H*(aq)]cam approximation, but you will then need to solve a
quadratic equation. A far easier method is to use one of the many quadratic
equation solver websites that you can find online.

Development of models to explain acid-base
behaviour
Acids have been known for thousands of years. As scientific knowledge
has increased, the definitions of an acid and a base have been modified
over time. The flowchart in Figure 1 highlights some of the changing
models of acid and base behaviour. Hydrogen was recognised as the
important chemical component in acid compounds in the 1830s and
this idea has been further refined since.
Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases
You have already seen that acids and alkalis release H and OH ions in
water. This is the Arrhenius model of acids and bases:
Early ideas: acids and alkalis
Acids are sour (Latin acidus = sour)
Alkalis from plant ashes
(Arabic al-quili = plant ashes)
acids dissociate and release H+ ions in aqueous solution
• alkalis dissociate and release OH ions in aqueous solution
• H+ ions are neutralised by OH-ions to form water:
H+ (aq) + OH(aq) → H2O(1)
An alkali is a soluble base.
1754, Guillaume François
Rouelle (French):
A "base' reacts with an acid
to give a solid form
The Brønsted-Lowry model for acids and bases extends this model to
emphasise the role of proton transfer between species.
role of hydrogen
A Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor.
A Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor.
1832, Justus Liebig (German):
Acids contain hydrogen that can
be replaced by a metal
Conjugate acid-base pairs

Svante Arrhenius (Swedish)
Acids form H+ ions.
• Bases form OH-ions.
central role of protons
Even though an equilibrium sign has been shown, HCl is a strong
acid and the equilibrium position is well over to the right-hand side.
A single arrow can be used to indicate that the forward reaction
effectively goes to completion.
Brønsted-Lowry model 1923, Johannes
Brønsted (Danish) and Thomas Lowry
(English)
Acid-base reactions transfer protons, H+.
• An acid donates a proton.
• A base accepts a proton.
HCl(aq) and Cl(aq) are called a conjugate acid-base pair.
A conjugate acid-base pair contains two species that can be
interconverted by transfer of a proton.
Figure 1 Some models that have
been used to describe acid and base
behaviour
In the forward direction, HCl releases a proton to form its
conjugate base, C.
In the reverse direction, Cl- accepts a proton to forms its
conjugate acid, HCI.
