many different substances.

Predicting redox reactions
Predictions can be made about the feasibility of any potential redox
reactions using standard electrode potentials. Table 1 shows three
redox systems sorted with the most negative standard electrode
potential at the top.
• The most negative system has the greatest tendency to be oxidised
and lose electrons.
The most positive system has the greatest tendency to be reduced and
gain electrons.
An oxidising agent takes electrons away from the species being
oxidised. So oxidising agents are reduced and are on the left. A
reducing agent adds electrons to the species being reduced. So
reducing agents are oxidised and are on the right (Table 1).
You can predict the feasibility of redox reactions from Eº values.
In Table 1, a reaction should take place between an oxidising agent
on the left and a reducing agent on the right, provided that the redox
system of the oxidising agent has a more positive E value than the
redox system of the reducing agent.
The strongest reducing agent is at the top on the right.
The strongest oxidising agent is at the bottom on the left

Comparing redox system C with A and B
Redox system C has a more positive EⓇ value and will have a greater
tendency to be reduced than redox systems A and B.
So the oxidising agent Ag+ (aq) on the left of C should react with
reducing agents on the right in redox systems A and B, that is, with Cr(s)
and Cu(s)
A Cr3+ (aq) + 3e
Cr(s)
B Cu2+ (aq) + 2e

Comparing redox system B with A and C
Redox system B has a more positive E value and will have a greater
tendency to be reduced than redox system A.
So the oxidising agent Cu2+ (aq) on the left of B should react with
reducing agents on the right in redox system A, that is, only with Cr(s).
A Cr3+ (aq) + 3e + Cr(s)
B Cu2+ (aq) + 2e
Cu(s)
Study tip
The explanation here is in terms of
the strength of oxidising agents.
This can also be explained in
terms of reducing agents. Both
approaches are equivalent and
give the same answer.
Comparing redox system A with B and C
The oxidising agent Cr+(aq) on the left of A will not react as there are
no redox systems with a less positive E value.

23.5 Predictions from electrode potentials
Study tip
For practice, combine the half
equations above to get these
overall equations.
Overall equation
To write overall equations, the half-equations must be combined. The
reduction half-equation is the same way round as the equilibrium. The
oxidation half-equation is obtained by reversing the equilibrium.
Combining the possible redox reactions above gives the following
equations:
Cr(s) + 3 Ag+ (aq) + Cr3+ (aq) + 3Ag(s)
Cu(s) + 2Agt → Cu2+(aq) + 2Ag
2Cr(s) + 3Cu2+ (aq) → 2Cr3+(aq) + 3Cu(s)
You can apply this same principle to any pair of redox systems. If they
are not ordered then just remember that:
the redox system with the more positive (less negative) E® value
will react from left to right, and gain electrons
the redox system with the less positive (more negative) EⓇ value
will react from right to left, and lose electrons.
Synoptic link
Limitations of predictions using Eº values
Reaction rate
One limitation of predictions for feasibility based on AG lies with reactions
that have a very large activation energy, resulting in a very slow rate. This
same limitation applied to predictions made based on E values.
So electrode potentials may indicate the thermodynamic feasibility of a
reaction, but they give no indication of the rate of a reaction.
For details of AG see Topic 22.5,
Free energy.
Concentration
Standard electrode potentials are measured using concentrations of
1 moldm . Many reactions take place using concentrated or dilute
solutions. If the concentration of a solution is not I moldm, then the
value of the electrode potential will be different from the standard value.
For example, the redox equilibrium and standard electrode potential
for the Zn2+ Zn redox system is shown below.
Zn2+(aq) + 2 = Zn(s) EⓇ = -0.76 V
If the concentration of Zn2+(aq) is greater than I moldm-?, the
equilibrium will shift to the right, removing electrons from the system
and making the electrode potential less negative.
In concentrations of Zn²+(aq) less than 1 moldm-3, the equilibrium
will shift to the left increasing electrons in the system and making the
electrode potential more negative.
Any change to the electrode potential will affect the value of the
overall cell potential.
Other factors
The actual conditions used for the reaction may be different from the
standard conditions used to record E values. This will affect the value
of the electrode potential.
Standard electrode potentials apply to aqueous equilibria. Many
reactions take place that are not aqueous.

Modern storage cells
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
→ modern storage cells

Modern cells and batteries
Our modern-day cells and batteries are based on the chemistry
introduced in Topic 23.4. The key requirement is for the two
electrodes to have different electrode potentials. You do not need
to learn details of any specific cell but you do need to apply the
important principles of electrode potentials, half-equations, and
cell reactions.
Cells can be divided into three main types – primary, secondary,
and fuel cells. Modern cells and batteries are part of a fast-moving
technological field, and much research is being carried out to develop
more efficient and effective portable sources of electrical energy.

orgizer
A Figure 1 A mixture of storage cells.
You can see the types on the labels
Study tip
The MnO,/Mn 0, system is more
positive and undergoes reduction,
providing the electrons. The Zn/Zn0
system is less positive and the
equilibrium equation is reversed. So
zinc is oxidised and manganese in
Mno, is reduced.
Primary cells
Primary cells are non-rechargeable and are designed to be used once
only. When in use, electrical energy is produced by oxidation and
reduction at the electrodes. However, the reactions cannot be reversed.
Eventually the chemicals will be used up, voltage will fall, the battery
will go flat, and the cell will be discarded or recycled. Primary cells
still find use for low-current, long-storage devices such as wall clocks
and smoke detectors. Most modern primary cells are alkaline based on
zinc and manganese dioxide, Zn/MnO, and a potassium hydroxide
alkaline electrolyte. The E values for the redox systems are shown
below.
ZnO(s) + H,O(l) + 2e = Zn(s) + 20H(aq)
EⓇ = -1.28 V
2Mn0,(s) + H,O(l) + 2e = Mn, 0,(s) + 20H-(aq) EⓇ = +0.15 V
Oxidation: Zn(s) + 20H(aq) → ZnO(s) + H2O(l) + 2e
Reduction: 2MnO,(s) + H2O(1) + 2e → Mn,,(s) + 2OH-(aq)
Cell reaction: Zn (s) + 2MnO2(5) → ZnO(s) + Mn,03(s) Ecell = 1.43 V
Secondary cells
Secondary cells are rechargeable. Unlike primary cells, the cell reaction
producing electrical energy can be reversed during recharging. The
chemicals in the cell are then regenerated and the cell can be used
again.
Common examples of secondary cells include:
lead-acid batteries used in car batteries
nickel-cadmium, NiCd, cells and nickel-metal hydride, NiMH - the
cylindrical batteries used in radios, torches, and so on.
lithium-ion and lithium-ion polymer cells used in our modern
appliances - laptops, tablets, cameras, mobile phones - and also
being developed for cars.

REDOX AND ELECTRODE POTENTIALS
Standard electrode potentials and AG
Feasibility has now been considered in terms of both AG and now E. It is
perhaps unsurprising that AG and E are connected mathematically:
AG = -nFE cell
Where n is amount, in moles, of electrons transferred in the balanced
equation and Fis the Faraday constant, 96 500 C mol-1.
When a cell reaction is written, Ecellis positive, calculated from:
E cell = E® (positive electrode) - E® (negative electrode)
For a standard cell constructed from Zn2+(aq)|Zn(s) and Cu2+(aq)|Cu(s)
half-cells the cell reaction and value of Eco
Zn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) → Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s) E cel = 1.10V
2 mol of electrons are transferred, so:
AGⓇ = - FER=-2 x 96 500 x 1.10 = -212 300J=-212 kJ
Providing that Ecellis positive, AG will be negative. The smaller the value of
E , the less negative the value of AG.

Table 1.
• The copper equilibrium has the more positive EⓇ and undergoes
reduction, gaining electrons. The reduction half equation is the same
way round as the equilibrium, with the electrons on the left-hand side.
The zinc equilibrium has the more negative EⓇ and undergoes oxidation,
losing electrons. So this equilibrium is reversed to give the oxidation half
equation with the electrons on the right-hand side.
The overall cell equation is obtained by combining the reduction and
oxidation half-equations.

Cu2+ (aq) + 2e Cu(s) positive electrode
oxidation:

equilibria are always written with
reduction (gaining electrons) in
the forward direction and oxidation

REDOX AND ELECTRODE POTENTIALS
Lithum-ion and lithium-ion polymer cells
Lithium-ion cells are extremely popular.
Lithium is a light metal, which translates into a very high energy density
when used in lithium-ion batteries.
The cells can be a regular shape, as in camera cells and also as lithium-ion
polymer pouch batteries, with an internal salt bridge made of a micro-porous
polymer covered in an electrolytic gel. Because the solid polymer is flexible,
flexible batteries can be easily formed into various shapes and sizes, ideal
for fitting round other components in a tightly-packed and lightweight
laptop, tablet, or mobile phone.
When a lithium-ion cell charges and discharges, electrons move through
the connecting wires to power the appliance, whilst Litions move between
the electrodes within the cell (Figure 2). The negative electrode is made of
graphite coated with lithium metal. The positive electrode is made out of a
metal oxide, typically Co Oy. The simplified reactions at each electrode during
use are shown below.
negative electrode: Li - Li+ + e
positive electrode: Li+ COO, + e Lico,
Figure 2 shows movement of Litions during discharge and a modern
lithium-ion polymer battery.
When fully charged, a lithium-ion cell has a voltage of 4.2 V but this drops
with use. The typical operating voltage is about 3.7-3.8V.
Lithium-ion cells do have some limitations. They can become unstable at
high temperatures and, on very rare occasions, they have ignited laptops
and mobile phones. Care must be taken in their recycling, as lithium is a
very reactive metal.
The standard electrode potential for Li* + = Li is -3.04V
a Assuming this value, what is the electrode potential of the Coo,
electrode at the fully charged state of the cell?
b Assuming that Co changes oxidation number, what is the change?
Figure 2 The structure of a typical
lithium-ion rechargeable battery.
The battery consists of a positive
electrode (green) and negative
electrode (red), with a layer (yellow)
separating them. When in use,
electrons (green arrow) flow from the
negative electrode to the positive
electrode and, at the same time, Li+
ions (blue) travel from the anode to
the cathode, to keep the electrical
charge balance in the cell. When
charging, the process is reversed and
lithium ions are transferred back to
the negative electrode
Fuel cells
A fuel cell uses the energy from the reaction of a fuel with oxygen to
create a voltage.
The fuel and oxygen flow into the fuel cell and the products flow
out. The electrolyte remains in the cell.
Fuel cells can operate continuously provided that the fuel and
oxygen are supplied into the cell.
Fuel cells do not have to be recharged.
Many different fuels can be used, but hydrogen is the most common.
Hydrogen fuel cells produce no carbon dioxide during combustion,
with water being the only combustion product. Fuel cells using many
other hydrogen-rich fuels, such as methanol, are also being developed.

Reducing and oxidising agents
You have seen that reduction and oxidation can be described in terms
of transfer of electrons or change in oxidation number:
Reduction - gain of electrons OR decrease in oxidation number.

Oxidising agents and reducing agents
In a redox reaction, there will always be an oxidising agent and a
reducing agent.
The oxidising agent takes electrons from the species being oxidised.
The oxidising agent contains the species that is reduced.
The reducing agent adds electrons to the species being reduced. The
reducing agent contains the species that is oxidised.
For example, the equation for the reaction between Ag+ ions and Cuis
shown below.
2Ag (aq) + Cu(s) → Cu2+(aq) + 2Ag(s)

language here. For example, nitric
acid, HNO3, is a strong oxidising
agent in many reactions. But
only the nitrogen atom in HNO, is

Electrochemical cells
In this topic you will be looking at a type of electrochemical cell called
a voltaic cell, which converts chemical energy into electrical energy.
The conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy takes place
in the modern cells and batteries that power devices such as mobile
phones. So what do you need to make a voltaic cell? As electrical
energy results from movement of electrons, you need chemical
reactions that transfer electrons from one species to another. These are
redox reactions.
Half cells
A half-cell contains the chemical species present in a redox
half-equation. A voltaic cell can be made by connecting together two
different half-cells, which then allows electrons to flow. In the cell, the
chemicals in the two half-cells must be kept apart - if allowed to mix,
electrons would flow in an uncontrolled way and heat energy would
be released rather than electrical energy.

Metal/metal ion half-cells
The simplest half-cell consists of a metal rod dipped into a solution
of its aqueous metal ion. This is represented using a vertical line for
the phase boundary between the aqueous solution and the metal, for
example, Zn2+(aq) Zn(s) and Cu2+(aq) Cu(s) half-cells are shown in
Figure 1.
At the phase boundary where the metal is in contact with its ions, an
equilibrium will be set up. By convention, the equilibrium in a
half-cell is written so that the forward reaction shows reduction and
the reverse reaction shows oxidation (Figure 2).
In an isolated half-cell, there is no net transfer of electrons either into
or out of the metal.
When two half-cells are connected, the direction of electron flow
depends upon the relative tendency of each electrode to release
electrons.

An ion/ion half-cell contains ions of the same element in different
oxidation states. For example, a half-cell can be made containing a
mixture of aqueous iron (II) and iron (III) ions. The redox equilibrium is:
Fe3+(aq) + = Fe2+(aq)
In this type of half-cell there is no metal to transport electrons either
into or out of the half-cell, so an inert metal electrode made out of
platinum is used. A half-cell based on Fe2+ (aq) and Fe3+(aq) ions is
shown in Figure 3.

REDOX AND ELECTRODE POTENTIALS
Electrode potentials
How do you know which electrode has a greater tendency to gain or
lose electrons? In a cell with two metal/metal ion half-cells connected,
the more reactive metal releases electrons more readily and is
oxidised.
In an operating cell:
the electrode with more reactive metal loses electrons and is
oxidised - this is the negative electrode
the electrode with the less reactive metal gains electrons and is
reduced - this is the positive electrode.

Standard electrode potential
The tendency to be reduced and gain electrons is measured as a
standard electrode potential E. The standard chosen is a half-cell
containing hydrogen gas, H, (g), and a solution containing H+(aq) ions.
An inert platinum electrode is used to allow electrons into and out of
the half-cell. Figure 4 shows a standard hydrogen electrode.
By definition, the standard conditions used are:
solutions have a concentration of exactly 1 mol dm3
. the temperature is 298 K (25 °C)
the pressure is 100 kPa (1 bar).
The standard electrode potential is the e.m.f. of a half-cell connected
to a standard hydrogen half-cell under standard conditions of 298K,
solution concentrations of 1 mol dm , and a pressure of 100 kPa.
By definition, the standard electrode potential of a standard hydrogen
electrode is exactly O V. The sign of a standard electrode potential
shows the sign of the half-cell connected to the standard hydrogen
electrode and shows the relative tendency to gain electrons compared
with the hydrogen half-cell.

Measuring a standard electrode potential
To measure a standard electrode potential, the
half-cell is connected to a standard hydrogen
electrode.
The two electrodes are connected by a wire
to allow a controlled flow of electrons.
The two solutions are connected with a
salt bridge which allows ions to flow. The
salt bridge typically contains a concentrated
solution of an electrolyte that does not
react with either solution. An example of a
salt bridge is a strip of filter paper soaked in
aqueous potassium nitrate, KNO, (aq).

Construction of redox equations using half-equations
You can write equations for a redox reaction from the half-equations
for the reduction and oxidation reactions. The procedure ensures that
the number of electrons that are transferred balance.
Synoptic link
You learnt in Topic 4.3, Redox,
that during a redox reaction,
the number of electrons lost
during oxidation must equal the
number of electrons gained during
reduction.
C Worked example: Writing a redox equation from
half-equations
The redox reaction between hydrogen peroxide, H,O,, and
alkaline Cr3+ ions has the following half-equations.
Write the overall redox equation.
reduction: H,02 + 2e → 20H-
oxidation: Cr3+ + SOH - Cro,- + 4H2O + 3e
Step 1: Balance the electrons:
The reduction equation is multiplied through by x 3 to give 6e .
A Figure 2 Oxidation of green Cr3+ ions
(left) in alkaline conditions by hydrogen
peroxide produces yellow chromate(VI)
ions, Cro - (right)
The oxidation equation is multiplied through by x 2 to also give 6e.
reduction ® 3: 3H,0, +6e →60H
oxidation x 2: 2Cr3+ + 160H → 2Cro,- + 8H,0 + 6e
Step 2: Add and cancel electrons:
3H,02 + 2Cr3+ + 160H + de – 60H- + 2Cro,2- + 8H2O + ÓC
31,0, +2Cr3+ + 160H – 60H + 2Cro 2- + 8H,0
Step 3: Finally cancel any species that are on both sides of the
equation:
Study tip
Look for number patterns. Here,
3 and 2 have the common linked
number of 2 x 3 = 6. You can
also use fractions and you may
find it easier just to multiply the
reduction equation by 1.5. This is
perfectly fine and just as correct.
Here, there are 160H on the left-hand side and 6OH on the
right-hand side. So you cancel to leave just 100H on the left-
hand side.
→ 601 + 2Cro, 2- + 8H,0
3H,0, + 2 Cr3+ + TOH
100H
34,02 + 2Cr3+ + 1004
– 200,2- + 8H,0
Using oxidation numbers to write equations
You can write an equation for a redox reaction from the oxidation
number of the species in the redox reaction. The procedure ensures
that the changes in oxidation number balance.
Study tip
When you have completed your
equation, have a final check to see
if there are any species that are on
both sides that need cancelling.
Synoptic link
Construction of redox equations using oxidation numbers
Oxidation numbers can be used to write and balance a redox equation.
By assigning oxidation numbers to all atoms in an equation, it is easy
to see which atoms have been reduced and which have been oxidised.
In Topic 4.3, Redox, you learnt that
in a redox reaction, the overall
increase in oxidation number
during oxidation must equal the
overall decrease in oxidation
number during reduction.
373
23
23.1 Redox reactions
To complete the equation, balance the changes in oxidation number as
shown in the worked example below.
This example is tricky to balance by trial and error as hydrogen and
oxygen appear in more than one product. The oxidation number
method takes much of the guesswork out of balancing redox
equations.
2) Worked example: Writing a redox equation from
oxidation numbers
Sulfur, S, reacts with concentrated nitric acid, HNO, to form
sulfuric acid, H2SO4, nitrogen dioxide, NOx, and water, H20.
Construct the overall equation for this redox reaction.
Study tip
In this equation, there are also
atoms of hydrogen and oxygen
but their oxidation numbers
do not change.
Step 1: Summarise the information provided.
S + HNO, - H2SO4 + NO + H2O
Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers to identify the atoms that
change their oxidation number.
S + HNO3 → H2SO4 + NO + H20
0
+6
oxidation number change: +6
+5
+4
oxidation number change: -1
Step 3: Balance only the species that contain the elements that
have changed oxidation number.
To match the increase of +6 for sulfur, you need a total decrease
of -6 from nitrogen.
So HNO, and NO, also need to be multiplied by 6 to give
6 X-1 = -6
S + 6HNO, H,SO4 + 6NO, + H2O
Step 4: Balance any remaining atoms.
As the oxidation numbers are now balanced, the hydrogen and
oxygen atoms are balanced by adding a 2 in front of the H,O.
S + 6HNO, + H2SO4 + 6NO2 + 2H,0
Study tip
Predicting products of redox reactions
In equations, you might not know all the species involved in the
reaction and you might need to predict any missing reactants or
products. In aqueous redox reactions, H,O is often formed. Other likely
products are H+ and OH-ions, depending on the conditions used.
As a final check, ensure that both sides of the equations are balanced
by charge.
The worked example shows how a half-equation can be predicted
using oxidation numbers.
Always make sensible predictions
- if your predicted formula looks
strange, you have probably made
up something that doesn't exist.

Standard electrode potentials have been measured for many different
redox systems and these are listed in data reference tables. Table 1
shows examples of standard electrode potentials. The equilibrium
is always shown so that the forward reaction is reduction. The
redox systems in Table 1 have been sorted in order of their standard
electrode potentials, with the most negative value at the top.
The more negative the EⓇ value:
the greater the tendency to lose electrons and undergo oxidation.
the less the tendency to gain electrons and undergo reduction
The more positive the E value:
the greater the tendency to gain electrons and undergo reduction
• the less the tendency to lose electrons and undergo oxidation.
Metals tend to have negative E values and lose electrons. Non-metals
tend to have positive E values and gain electrons.
In general:
The more negative the Evalue, the greater the reactivity of a metal in
losing electrons.
• The more positive the E® value, the greater the reactivity of a
non-metal in gaining electrons.

. For an ion/ion half-cell, both metal ions present in the solution must
have the same concentration. There must be an inert electrode,
usually platinum.
For a half-cell containing gases (e.g., a hydrogen half-cell), the gas
must be at 100 kPa pressure, in contact with a solution with an
ionic concentration of 1 mol dm-3. There must be an inert electrode,
usually platinum.

23.3 lodine/thiosulfate redox titrations
Analysis of copper
Iodine/thiosulfate titrations can be used to determine the copper
content of copper(II) salts or alloys. For copper(II) salts, Cu2+(aq) ions
are produced simply by dissolving the compound in water. Insoluble
copper(II) compounds can be reacted with acids to form Cu²+ (aq) ions.
For copper alloys, such as brass or bronze, the alloy is reacted and
dissolved in concentrated nitric acid, followed by neutralisation to
form Cu2+ (aq) ions:
Cu(s)
Cu2+(aq)
In this analysis:
Cu2+(aq) ions react with I-(aq) to form a solution of iodine, I, (aq),
and a white precipitate of copper(I) iodide, Cul(s). The mixture
appears as a brown colour.

The iodine in the brown mixture is then titrated with a standard
solution of sodium thiosulfate:
25,0,-(aq) + 12(aq) — 21- (aq) + 5,02-(aq)
2 mol Cu2+ produces 1 mol iodine which reacts with 2 mol 5,0
So I mol Cu2+ is equivalent to 1 mol 5,0,2-
6 Worked example: Analysis of brass
Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is used in many ornaments
and in brass musical instruments. Brass can be analysed using an
iodine/thiosulfate titration to find its percentage of copper and zinc.
A sample of brass is analysed using the practical procedure
outlined below.
A 0.500 g sample of brass is reacted with concentrated nitric
acid to form a solution containing Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions. The
solution is then neutralised.
Excess Kl(aq) is added. Cu2+ ions react with lions, forming I,.
The iodine is titrated with 0.200 moldm-3 sodium thiosulfate
and 25.20 cm are required to reach the end point.
Calculate the percentage by mass of copper and zinc in the brass.

Step 3: Balance any remaining atoms and predict any further
species.
There are four oxygen atoms and H+ on the left-hand side but no
hydrogen or oxygen atoms on the right hand side.
A likely product is H2O.
Add 4,0 to the right hand side and balance the H,O. Finally
balance the H+.

23.3 lodine/thiosulfate redox titrations
Specification reference: 5.2.3
lodine/thiosulfate titrations
In iodine-thiosulfate titrations, thiosulfate ions, 5.0,- (aq), are
oxidised and iodine, Iy, is reduced.
Oxidation: 25,032-(aq) →$402-(aq) + 2e
Reduction: 12(aq) + 2e → 21 (aq)
Overall: 25,0,2-(aq) + 12(aq) — 21"(aq) +S402-(aq)
The concentration of aqueous iodine can be determined by titration
with a standard solution of sodium thiosulfate. If it were possible to
analyse only iodine, this titration would be very limiting. However, by
adding another step to the process, it is possible to obtain unknown
information about many different oxidising agents.

lodine/thiosulfate titrations can be used to determine:
the CIO content in household bleach
the Cu2+ content in copper(11) compounds
the Cu content in copper alloys.
Procedure
Titrate this solution with the Na,s,o,(aq). During the
titration, the iodine is reduced back to lions and the
brown colour fades quite gradually, making it difficult
to decide on an end point. This problem is solved by
using starch indicator. When the end point is being
approached, the iodine colour has faded enough to
become a pale straw colour. The fading of the yellow-
brown iodine colour as aqueous sodium thiosulfate is
added is shown in Figure 1.
1 Add a standard solution of Na,s,, to the burette.
2 Prepare a solution of the oxidising agent to be
analysed. Using a pipette, add this solution to a
conical flask. Then add an excess of potassium iodide.
The oxidising agent reacts with iodide ions to produce
iodine, which turns the solution a yellow-brown colour.

Using starch for the end point
When the end point is being approached and the iodine colour has faded
enough to become a pale straw colour, a small amount of starch indicator is
added. A deep blue-black colour forms to assist with the identification of the
end point. As more sodium thiosulfate is added, the blue-black colour fades.
At the end point, all the iodine will have just reacted and the blue-black
colour disappears (Figure 2).

Examples of iodine-thiosulfate titrations
Two worked examples are provided for the analysis of two different
oxidising agents:
• chlorate (I) ions, ClO (aq)
copper(II) ions, Cu2+(aq).
The same principles can be applied for the analysis of other oxidising
agents, provided that they are capable of oxidising I-ions to I,.
Analysis of household bleach
The active ingredient in household bleach is chlorate (1) ions, CIO-(aq),
commonly known as 'hypochlorite'. Many bottles of bleach show the Nacio
content, which supplies the active hypochlorite (CIO) ions as labelled on the
bottle (Figure 2).
JITENDED
In this analysis, we will calculate the concentration of CIO-ions in bleach, in
mol dm-3.
INGREDIENTS:
Disinfectant: Sodium Hypochlorite
4.5 per 100g
<5% Chlorine based bleach agent
(Sodium Hypochlorite); Non-ionic
surfactants; Cationic surfactants; Soap:
Perfume.
• CIO-ions from the bleach are first reacted with and Htions to form Iz:
CIO (aq) + 21- (aq) + 2H+ (aq) → C1- (aq) +l2(aq) + H20(1)
• In the titration, l, reacts with 5,0, 2-ions:
25,0,?- (aq) +12(aq) — 21- (aq) +S406?- (aq)
1 mol ClO mol produces 1 moll, which reacts with 2 mol 5,032-.
So 1 mol CIOmol is equivalent to 2n

Carrying out redox titrations
For redox titrations, the procedures are very similar to acid-base
titrations and any differences will be described in examples.
You will be studying two common redox titrations:
• potassium manganate (VII) (KMnO, (aq)) under acidic conditions
• sodium thiosulfate (Na,S,, (aq)) for determination of iodine (I, (aq)).
Manganate(VII) titrations
In manganate(VII) titrations, MnO,- (aq) ions are reduced and so the other
chemical used must be a reducing agent that is oxidised.

For full details for preparing
standard solutions and carrying
out a titration, see Topic 4.2,
Acid-base titrations.
Procedure
1 A standard solution of potassium manganate(VII), KMnO4, is added to
the burette.
Using a pipette, add a measured volume of the solution being analysed
to the conical flask. An excess of dilute sulfuric acid is also added to
provide the H(aq) ions required for the reduction of MnO (aq) ions. You
do not need to add an indicator, as the reaction is self-indicating
During the titration, the manganate(VII) solution reacts and is
decolourised as it is being added. The end point of the titration is judged
by the first permanent pink colour, indicating when there is an excess of
MnO,-ions present. In titrations, this end point is one of the easiest to
judge. You can see these changes in Figure 1.
Repeat the titration until you obtain concordant titres (two titres that
agree within +0.10 cm).
Reading the meniscus
KMnO,(aq) is a deep purple colour and it is very difficult
to see the bottom of the meniscus through the intense
colour. In manganate(VII) titrations, burette readings are
read from the top, rather than the bottom, of the meniscus.
The titre is the difference between the two readings, so the
titre is the same as reading the bottom of the meniscus,
provided that the top is used for both initial and final
burette readings.
