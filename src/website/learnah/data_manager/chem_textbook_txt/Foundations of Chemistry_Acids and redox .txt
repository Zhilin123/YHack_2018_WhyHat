ACIDS AND REDOX
The mean titre
When working out the mean titre, it is important to use only your
closest accurate titres.
Synoptic link
As part of the practical skills
required for your course, you need
to know how to measure mass,
volumes of solutions, and volumes
of gases.
• By repeating titres until two agree within 0.10 cm, you can reject
inaccurate titres.
• If you were to include all the titres in the mean, you have lost the
accuracy of the titration technique.

Titration calculations
From the results of a titration, you will know the following:
The practical application boxes in
this topic tell you how to measure
the volume of solutions.
• both the concentration c, and the reacting volume V, of one of the
solutions
• only the reacting volume V2 of the other solution,
The method for analysing the results follows a set pattern.
Measuring mass, volumes of
solutions, and volumes of gases
are also covered in:
Topic 3.2, Determination of
formulae, for how to measure
mass
Step 1: Work out the amount, in mol, of the solute in the solution for
which you know both the concentration c, and volume V.
Step 2: Use the equation to work out the amount, in mol, of the
solute in the other solution.
Step 3: Work out the unknown information about the solute in the
other solution.

Pipette:
25.00 cm of 0.100 moldm’ KOH(aq)
Mean titre from burette: 25.70 cm of H,SO(aq)
Unknown information: The concentration of H2SO4(aq)
Step 1: From the titration results, calculate the amount of KOH.

You can use the titration technique to work out some unknown
information about a substance, for example, you can identify an
unknown carbonate, X_CO2.
The key steps are shown below, together with results.
1 Prepare a solution of an unknown carbonate, X,CO,, in a volumetric flask.
2 Using a pipette, measure 25.00 cm of your prepared solution into a
conical flask.
3 Using a burette, titrate this solution using 0.100 mol dm3 hydrochloric acid.

Study tip
You might be given a structured
calculation - you will be helped
through the calculation with
prompts similar to the bullet
points in this example.
But you might also be given an
unstructured calculation with no
help. You should practise both
structured titration calculations
and the harder unstructured
problems.
Analysis
Step 1: Calculate the amount of HCl that reacted.
Use the mean titre Vand the concentration of the hydrochloric acid c.
n(HCI) = < xao = 0.100 x 47,90 = 0.002 24 mol
Step 2: Determine the amount of X,Co, that reacted.
Use the equation and n(HCI).
X.CO2(aq) + 2 HCl(aq) - X,50, (aq) + H20(1) + CO2(g)
1 mol 2 mol (balancing numbers)
0.001 12 mol 0.002 24 mol HCI
Step 3: Work out the unknown information. There are several stages.
1 Scale up to find the amount of X,Co, in the 250 cm solution that you
prepared.
n(X.CO2) in 25.00 cm used in the titration = 0.001 12 mol
n(X,C02) in 250.0 cm solution
= 0.001 12 x 10 = 0.0112 mol
2 Find the molar mass of X,CO..
Use the amount, n(x,Co), in the 250 cm solution and the mass m of
X.CO, used to prepare this solution.
Study tip
The scaling here is obvious
because 250 is 10 times larger
than 25. If you were scaling up a
burette reading (say 29.55 cm),
the process is the same, but you
would need to find the scaling
factor by dividing 250 by the titre.
n(X.CO) = m

4.3 Redox
You have already seen that polyatomic ions containing oxygen,
such as NO,- and NO,, are sometimes named using -ite and -ate.
Although still in common usage, use of -ite and -ate in naming is

Roman numerals.

• sulfate is assumed to be SO 2-
Redox reactions
Reduction and oxidation
Originally the terms oxidation and reduction were used solely for
reactions involving oxygen.
Oxidation is addition of oxygen.
Reduction is removal of oxygen.
The reaction below shows oxidation and reduction:
CuO(s) + H2(g) + Cu(s) + H2O(1)
Figure 1 Reduction of copper(II)
oxide with hydrogen - the green flame is
excess hydrogen burning off
Copper(II) oxide has lost oxygen and has been reduced.
Hydrogen has gained oxygen and has been oxidised.
Redox reactions involve reduction and oxidation. If one process
happens, so must the other – if something is reduced, something else
must be oxidised.
The terms oxidation and reduction are now applied to many reactions
that do not involve oxygen. The modern definitions are in terms of
either electrons or oxidation number.
Study tip
Remember OILRIG:
Redox in terms of electrons
Reduction is the gain of electrons.
• Oxidation is the loss of electrons.
The redox reaction below does not involve oxygen but does involve
gain and loss of electrons.

OIL Oxidation Is Loss of electrons
RIG Reduction Is Gain of electrons.
4.2 Acid-base titrations
Acid-base titrations
Apparatus
In an acid-base titration, a solution of an acid is titrated against a
solution of a base using a pipette and a burette, which are typically
manufactured to the tolerances below:
• a 10 cm pipette: +0.04 cm3
. a 25 cm pipette: +0.06 cm
a 50 cm burette: +0.10 cm.
A burette reading is recorded to the nearest half division, with the
bottom of the meniscus on a mark or between two marks. Each
burette reading is measured to the nearest +0.05 cm so the reading
always has two decimal places, the last place being either 0 or 5, for
example, 25.40 cm or 26.25 cm'.
A Figure 3 When filling a burette, run
excess solution out through the tap to
remove any air bubbles. If a bubble is left
in the neck of the burette, the air could
be released during the titration, leading
to an error in the titre
The acid-base titration procedure
1 Add a measured volume of one solution to a conical flask using a pipette.
2 Add the other solution to a burette, and record the initial burette reading
to the nearest 0.05 cm
3 Add a few drops of an indicator to the solution in the conical flask.
Run the solution in the burette into the solution in the conical flask,
swirling the conical flask throughout to mix the two solutions. Eventually
the indicator changes colour at the end point of the titration. The end
point is used to indicate the volume of one solution that exactly reacts
with the volume of the second solution.
Record the final burette reading. The volume of solution added from the
burette is called the titre, which is calculated by subtracting the initial
from the final burette reading.
6 A quick, trial titration is carried out first to find the approximate titre.
7 The titration is then repeated accurately, adding the solution dropwise as
the end point is approached. Further titrations are carried out until two
accurate titres are concordant - agreeing to within 0.10 cm.
The readings from the titration are recorded in a table such as Table 1.

Titrations
A titration is a technique used to accurately measure the volume of
one solution that reacts exactly with another solution. Titrations can
be used for:
finding the concentration of a solution
• identification of unknown chemicals
finding the purity of a substance.

Checking purity is an important aspect of quality control, especially
for compounds manufactured for human use such as medicines, food,
and cosmetics. It is essential that pharmaceuticals have a high level
of purity - just a tiny amount of an impurity in a drug could cause
a great deal of harm to a patient.

Preparing a standard solution
A standard solution is a solution of known concentration.
A volumetric flask is used to make up a standard solution very
accurately. Volumetric flasks are manufactured in various sizes and
can measure volumes very precisely. The volumetric flasks that you
will use are manufactured to the typical tolerances below:
Standard solutions were
introduced in Topic 3.3, Moles
and volumes.

The solid is first weighed accurately.
The solid is dissolved in a beaker using less distilled water than will be
needed to fill the volumetric flask to the mark.
This solution is transferred to a volumetric flask. The last traces of the
solution are rinsed into the flask with distilled water.
The flask is carefully filled to the graduation line by adding distilled water
a drop at a time until the bottom of the meniscus lines up exactly with
the mark (Figure 1). Care at this stage is essential - if too much water
is added, the solution will be too dilute and must be prepared again. You
should view the graduation mark and meniscus at eye level for accuracy.
Finally, the volumetric flask is slowly inverted several times to mix the
solution thoroughly. If this stage is omitted, titration results are unlikely to
be consistent. You will be able to see the solution mixing when you invert
the flask as the more dense original solution moves through the solution.

Acids
All acids contain hydrogen in their formulae (Table 1). When dissolved
in water, an acid releases hydrogen ions as protons, H+, into the solution.
In the equation below, hydrogen chloride gas releases H+ ions as it
dissolves in water.
HCl(g) + aq

Strong and weak acids
A strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, HCl, releases all its
hydrogen atoms into solution as Hions and completely dissociates
in aqueous solution.
HCl(aq) + H+ (aq) + Cl (aq)
Synoptic link
You will learn more and equilibrium
and weak acids in Chapter 20, Acids,
bases, and pH.
A weak acid, such as ethanoic acid, CH,COOH, only releases a small
proportion of its available hydrogen atoms into solution as H+ ions.
A weak acid partially dissociates in aqueous solution.
CH,COOH(aq) = H+ (aq) + CH,C00-(aq)
The equilibrium sign = indicates that the forward reaction is incomplete.
with bits
It is important to realise that not all compounds that contain hydrogen
atoms are acids. Each molecule of ethanoic acid contains four
hydrogen atoms, but only the hydrogen atom on the COOH group is
released as H+. Even then, only about one molecule in every hundred
dissociates, so ethanoic acid is a weak acid. Most organic acids, like
ethanoic acid, are weak acids.

Bases and alkalis
Metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal carbonates, and ammonia, NH,
are classified as bases. A base neutralises an acid to form a salt. Table 2

vinegar contains ethanoic acid, orange
and lemon juice and even sink cleaner

hydroxide releasing hydroxide ions as it dissolves in water.

4.1 Acids, bases, and neutralisation
Study tip
Neutralisation of acids with carbonates
Like metal oxides, carbonates neutralise acids to form a salt and water.
There is also a third product, carbon dioxide gas. The equations show
neutralisation of two carbonates by sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid.
Remember the equation for the
neutralisation of acids by metal
carbonates.
acid + metal carbonate
salt + water + carbon dioxide(g)
ZnCO3(s) + H2SO,(aq) ZnSO4(aq) + H2O(1) + CO2(g)
MgCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) – MgCl2 (aq) + H2O(1) + CO2(g)
It will help you write the equation
for any neutralisation of this type.
Dissociation in sulfuric acid
Sulfuric acid, H,50%, is a strong acid, but this is true only for one of the two
hydrogen atoms. When sulfuric acid is mixed with water each H, SO, molecule
dissociates, releasing just one of its two hydrogen atoms as an Htion:
H,50, (aq) –H(aq) + HSO4 (aq)
The resulting HSO4 (aq) ions then only partially dissociate:
HS0, (aq) =H*(aq) + S0,2-(aq)
• Sulfuric acid first behaves as a strong acid.
The HSO, ions formed behave as a weak acid.
Other strong acids containing more than one hydrogen atom behave similarly.

phosphoric acid, H2PO4

Baking powder usually contains an organic acid and
sodium hydrogencarbonate, NaHCO,, also known as
bicarbonate of soda. Sodium hydrogencarbonate is an
acid salt, formed by partial neutralisation of carbonic
acid, H,CO2, with sodium hydroxide.

Neutralisation
In neutralisation of an acid, H+(aq) ions react with a base to form a salt
and neutral water. The H+ ions from the acid are replaced by metal or
ammonium ions from the base. Table 3 shows salts of common acids.

sodium hydroxide, NaOH
Notice the link between the name of the acid and the salt, in blue.
To form the salt, the hydrogen (shown in purple) in the acid is
replaced by a metal or ammonium ion to form the salt.

Neutralisation of acids with metal oxides and hydroxides
An acid is neutralised by a metal oxide or metal hydroxide to form a
salt and water only. The equations below show the neutralisation of
sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid by copper(II)oxide to form a salt
and water only. Figure 3 shows solutions of the salts formed.
CuO(s) + H,SO,(aq) + CuSO4(aq) + H2O(l)
CuO (s) + 2HCl(aq) → CuCl(aq) + H20(1)
Learn this to help you write the
equation for any neutralisation by
a metal oxide or hydroxide.
Alkalis
With alkalis, the reactants are in solution. As with metal oxides, the
overall reaction forms a salt and water only:
acid + alkali — salt + water
The ionic equation, shown below, is much simpler than the overall
equation: neutralisation of H(aq) ions by OH(aq) ions to form
neutral water, H, O(l).
Full equation: HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(1)
Ionic equation: H(aq) + OH-(aq)
H 0(1)

Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
→ oxidation number
→ oxidation and reduction
→ redox reactions.
Oxidation number
Oxidation number is based on a set of rules that apply to atoms,
and can be thought of as the number of electrons involved in bonding
to a different element. Use of oxidation numbers helps when writing
formulae and balancing electrons as a check that all electrons have
been accounted for.
Rules for elements
The oxidation number is always zero for elements.
Study tip
•
In a pure element, any bonding is to atoms of the same element.
So in H, O, P, S,, Na, and Fe the oxidation number of each atom
of the element is 0.
It is a common mistake to confuse
oxidation numbers of elements
and ions. The oxidation number of
oxygen in 0, is zero but in H,0 is -2.
Rules for compounds and ions
Each atom in a compound has an oxidation number.
An oxidation number has a sign, which is placed before
the number.
Table 1 shows examples of oxidation numbers of atoms in compounds
and ions, including some special cases. The oxidation number of an
ion of an element is numerically the same as the ionic charge but the
sign comes before the number.

Working out oxidation numbers
In addition to the rules in Table 1, there is a further rule for

3 Finally use M(XC02) to identify X in the formula X_C03.
106.25 = M(x) x 2 + 12.0 + (16.0 x 3) = 2M(X) +60.0
M(X) = 106.25 – 60.0 = 23.125 g mol-1
From the periodic table, 23.125 most closely matches Na (4. = 23.0).
