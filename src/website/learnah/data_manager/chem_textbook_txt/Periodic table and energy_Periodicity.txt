7.2 lonisation energies
Comparing beryllium and boron
The fall in first ionisation energy from beryllium to boron marks the start
of filling the 2p sub-shell (Figure 5).
The 2p sub-shell in boron has a higher energy than the 2s sub-shell
in beryllium. Therefore, in boron the 2p electron is easier to remove
than one of the 2s electrons in beryllium. The first ionisation energy of
boron is less than the first ionisation energy of beryllium.

In nitrogen and oxygen the highest energy electrons are in a
2p sub-shell.
In oxygen, the paired electrons in one of the 2p orbtals repel one
another, making it easier to remove an electron from an oxygen
atom than a nitrogen atom.
Therefore the first ionisation energy of oxygen is less than the first
ionisation energy of nitrogen.

Sub-shell trends in first ionisation energy
Although first ionisation energy shows a general increase across both
Period 2 and Period 3, it does fall in two places in each period. The
drops occur at the same positions in each period, suggesting that there
might be a periodic cause. The reason is linked to the existence of
sub-shells, their energies, and how orbitals fill with electrons.
Review Topic 5.1, Electron structure,
for details about the electron
structure, shells, sub-shells,
and orbitals.
Across Period 2, the first ionisation energy graph (Figure 4) shows three
rises and two falls:

Summary questions
Across Period 2 and Period 3,
the melting point increases from Group 1 to Group 14 (4)
there is a sharp decrease in melting point between Group 14 (4)
and Group 15 (5)
the melting points are comparatively low from Group 15 (5) to
Group 18 (0).
The sharp decrease in melting point marks a change from giant to
simple molecular structures, shown in Figure 11. You can also see the
start of the diagonal divide between metals and non-metals.
On melting, giant structures have strong forces to overcome so have
high melting points. Simple molecular structures have weak forces to
overcome, so have much lower melting points.
The trend in melting points across Period 2 is repeated across Period 3,
and continues across the s- and p-blocks from Period 4 downwards.

The periodic table
The periodic table - then
Just over 60 elements were known when Mendeleev arranged
them in order of atomic mass (nothing was known about subatomic
particles and atomic number at the time). He also lined up the
elements in groups with similar properties. If the group properties
did not fit, Mendeleev swapped elements around and left gaps,
assuming that the atomic mass measurements were incorrect
and that some elements were yet to be discovered. He even
predicted properties of the missing elements from group trends
- a remarkable insight at the time. It was not until protons were
discovered in the early 1900s that the real reason for the order in
Mendeleev's table was revealed.
Focus on ekasilicon

Mendeleev was so confident in his periodic law that
he predicted the properties of elements that would fill
the gaps in his periodic table. In 1871, he predicted the
properties of an undiscovered element that would fit in
the gap below silicon. He called this element 'ekasilicon'.

The periodic table - now
As of 2014, the periodic table has 114 elements arranged in seven
horizontal periods and 18 vertical groups (Figure 2). The periodic
table is the most important organisational tool in chemistry. It is the
first point of reference for chemists everywhere and most chemistry
laboratories have a periodic table prominently placed on the wall.
You do not need to memorise the periodic table (although some
people have done so). It is nevertheless helpful to know where the
common elements are positioned, and most students know the atomic
numbers and relative atomic masses of common elements such as
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. It is essential that you are
able to use the periodic table.

7.1 The periodic table
Across each period, there is a repeating trend in properties of the
elements, called periodicity. The most obvious periodicity in
properties is the trend from metals to non-metals. The topics in
this chapter look at periodicity of several properties:
electron configuration
ionisation energy
structure
melting points.
Periodic trend in electron configuration
The chemistry of each element is determined by its electron configuration,
particularly the outer, highest energy electron shell. Figure 3 shows the
electron configuration for elements in the first three periods.

Trend across a period
Each period starts with an electron in a new highest energy shell.
Study tip
A repeating, periodic pattern
is called periodicity. There is a
periodicity in electron configuration
in the periodic table. This is where
the periodic table gets its name.
Across Period 2, the 2s sub-shell fills with two electrons, followed
by the 2p sub-shell with six electrons.
• Across Period 3, the same pattern of filling is repeated for the
3s and 3p sub-shells.
Across Period 4, although the 3d sub-shell is involved, the
highest shell number is n = 4. From the n = 4 shell, only the 4s and
4p sub-shells are occupied.
For each period, the s-and p-sub-shells are filled in the same way - a
periodic pattern.

In Topic 8.1, Group 2, and Topic 8.2,
The halogens, you will study the

Trend down a group
You will know from GCSE that elements in each group have atoms
with the same number of electrons in their outer shell. Elements
in each group also have atoms with the same number of electrons in
each sub-shell. This similarity in electron configuration gives elements
in the same group their similar chemistry.
Blocks
The elements in the periodic table can be divided into blocks
corresponding to their highest energy sub-shell. This gives four distinct

Figure 2 The periodic table
Arranging the elements
The arrangement, pattern, and shape of the periodic table reveal
trends among the elements. The positions of the elements in the
periodic table are linked to their physical and chemical properties.
This makes the periodic table essential for predicting the properties
of elements and their compounds.
Atomic number
Reading from left to right, the elements are arranged in order of
increasing atomic number. Each successive element has atoms with
one extra proton - H1, He 2, Li 3, Be 4, and so on.
Groups
The elements are arranged in vertical columns called groups. Each
element in a group has atoms with the same number of outer-shell
electrons and similar properties.
Periods and periodicity
The elements are arranged in horizontal rows called periods. The
number of the period gives the number of the highest energy electron
shell in an element's atoms.

Giant covalent structures
You already know that many non-metallic elements exist as simple
covalently bonded molecules. In the solid state, these molecules form a
simple molecular lattice structure held together by weak intermolecular
forces. These structures therefore have low melting and boiling points.
See Topic 6.3, Intermolecular forces,
if you need to review the simple
molecular lattice structures of
covalently bonded molecules.
The non-metals boron, carbon, and silicon have very different lattice
structures. Instead of small molecules and intermolecular forces, many
billions of atoms are held together by a network of strong covalent
bonds to form a giant covalent lattice.
Carbon and silicon are in Group 14 (4) of the periodic table and their
atoms have four electrons in the outer shells. Carbon (in its diamond
form) and silicon use these four electrons to form covalent bonds to
other carbon or silicon atoms. The result is a tetrahedral structure, as
shown in Figure 5 for carbon (diamond).
Figure 5 shows the tetrahedral arrangement of atoms in the
diamond form of carbon.
The bond angles are all 109.5° by electron-pair repulsion.
The dot-and-cross diagram shows part of the covalently bonded
network of carbon atoms.
A Figure 5 Structure and bonding in
carbon (diamond)
Properties
Typical properties of substances with a giant covalent lattice structure
are shown below. The properties are dominated by the strong covalent
bonds, which make for very stable structures that are very difficult to
break down.
Synoptic link
Review electron-pair repulsion in
Topic 6.1, Shapes of molecules
and ions.
Melting and boiling points
Giant covalent lattices have high melting and boiling points. This is
because covalent bonds are strong. High temperatures are necessary
to provide the large quantity of energy needed to break the strong
covalent bonds.
Solubility
Giant covalent lattices are insoluble in almost all solvents.
The covalent bonds holding together the atoms in the lattice
are far too strong to be broken by interaction with solvents.
Electrical conductivity
Giant covalent lattices are non-conductors of electricity. The only
exceptions are graphene and graphite, which are forms of carbon.
• In carbon (diamond) and silicon, all four outer-shell electrons are
involved in covalent bonding, so none are available for conducting
electricity.
Carbon is special in forming several structures in which one of the
electrons is available for conductivity. Graphene and graphite are
able to conduct electricity.

PERIODICITY
Successive ionisation energies are defined in the same way as the first
ionisation energy. Just be careful with the species losing the electron.
Study tip
The second ionisation energy is the energy required to remove
one electron from each atom in one mole of gaseous 1+ ions of an element
to form one mole of gaseous 2+ ions.
Don't get your ionisation energies
muddled. The number of the
ionisation energy is the same as
the charge on the ion produced.
For helium, the second ionisation
energy produces a 2+ ion from
a 1+ ion.
Successive ionisation energies and shells
Successive ionisation energies provide important evidence for the
different electron energy levels in an atom. Figure 2 shows a graph
for the successive ionisation energies of fluorine.

The large increase between the seventh and eighth ionisation energies
suggests that the eighth electron must be removed from a different

Make sure that you get the shells
the right way round.
The first shell (n = 1, closer to the nucleus) contains two electrons.
The second shell (n = 2, the outer shell) contains seven electrons.
The electrons with the largest
ionisation energy are from the

Making predictions from successive ionisation energies
Successive ionisation energies allow predictions to be made about:
the number of electrons in the outer shell
the group of the element in the periodic table

The ionisation energies shown in Table 1 steadily increase but then
there is a large increase between the third and fourth ionisation
energies. This shows that the fourth electron is being removed from
an inner shell. Therefore there are three electrons in the outer shell
and the element must be in Group 13 (3). Since it is in Period 3, the
element must be aluminium.

a sharp decrease in first ionisation energy between the end of one

These trends can be explained in terms of atomic radius, electron
shielding, and nuclear charge.
Trend in first ionisation energy down a group
First ionisation energies decrease down a group. You can see this trend
in Figure 3 and Table 2 by comparing the three noble gases helium,
neon, and argon.

Down a group, the increased
atomic radius and shielding are
the important factors for the
decrease in first ionisation energy.
Table 2 explains the decrease in first ionisation energies down a group.
First ionisation energy decreases down every group in the periodic
table for the same reasons. Although the nuclear charge increases, its
effect is outweighed by the increased radius and, to a lesser extent, the
increased shielding.

7.3 Periodic trends in bonding and structure
Graphene and graphite
Apart from diamond, carbon forms giant covalent
structures based on planar hexagonal layers.
You can see from the dot-and-cross diagram in Figure 7
that only three electrons of the four outer-shell electrons
are used in covalent bonding. The remaining electron
is released into a pool of delocalised electrons shared
by all atoms in the structure. Structures of carbon
containing planar hexagonal layers are therefore good
electrical conductors.
C
Graphene and graphite are both giant covalent structures
of carbon based on planar hexagonal layers with bond
angles of 120° by electron-pair repulsion.
Graphene
Graphene is a single layer of graphite, composed of
hexagonally arranged carbon atoms linked by strong
covalent bonds (Figure 8). Graphene has the same
electrical conductivity as copper, and is the thinnest and
strongest material ever made.
A Figure 7 Planar hexagonal layer (top)
and dot-and-cross diagram (bottom) in
graphene and graphite layers
Graphite
Graphite is composed of parallel layers of hexagonally
arranged carbon atoms, like a stack of graphene layers
(Figure 9). The layers are bonded by weak London forces.
Graphene was discovered in 2004 by Andre Geim and
Konstantin Novoselov from the University of Manchester.
They were awarded a Nobel prize in 2010. Geim famously
made graphene by using sticky tape to pull single layers
of carbon atoms from the surface of graphite. Such a
simple idea to start work that won a Nobel prize!

The bonding in the hexagonal layers only uses three of
carbon's four outer-shell electrons. The spare electron
is delocalised between the layers, so electricity can be
conducted as in metals.

What is ionisation energy?
Ionisation energy measures how easily an atom loses electrons to
form positive ions.

energies across a period.
The first ionisation energy is the energy required to remove one
electron from each atom in one mole of gaseous atoms of an element
to form one mole of gaseous 1+ ions. For example:
Na(g) → Nat(g) + e first ionisation energy = +496 kJ mol-!
Factors affecting ionisation energy
Electrons are held in their shells by attraction from the nucleus. The
first electron lost will be in the highest energy level and will experience
the least attraction from the nucleus. For example, the first electron lost
from a sodium atom (1s 2s 2p 3s) is from the 3s sub-shell.
Three factors affect the attraction between the nucleus and the outer
electrons of an atom, and therefore, the ionisation energy.
Synoptic link
You saw that electron sub-shells
are filled from the lowest energy
level upwards in Topic 5.1,
Electron structure.
Atomic radius
The greater the distance between the nucleus and the outer electrons,
the less the nuclear attraction. The force of attraction falls off sharply
with increasing distance, so atomic radius has a large effect.
Nuclear charge
The more protons there are in the nucleus of an atom, the greater the
attraction between the nucleus and the outer electrons.
Electron shielding
Electrons are negatively charged and so inner-shell electrons repel
outer-shell electrons. This repulsion, called the shielding effect,
reduces the attraction between the nucleus and the outer electrons.
Successive ionisation energies
An element has as many ionisation energies as there are electrons.
For example, helium has two electrons and two ionisation energies:
HYUNTA
He(g)
He+(g)
+
→
Het(g) + e first ionisation energy
He2+(g) + e- second ionisation energy
Figure 1 An ionised gas is called
a plasma. Lightning is an example of
ionisation. Neon lights work by ionising
neon gas sealed in a tube at low
pressure. The plasma gives out light
when electricity passes through it, just
as it does in lightning
The second ionisation energy of helium is greater than the first
ionisation energy. In a helium atom, there are two protons attracting
two electrons in the ls sub-shell. After the first electron is lost, the
single electron is pulled closer to the helium nucleus. The nuclear
attraction on the remaining electron increases and more ionisation
energy will be needed to remove this second electron.

7.3 Periodic trends in bonding and structure
In Figure 2, there are 12 cations, each with a l+ charge, and
12 electrons, each with a l- charge. This balances the charge. For
metals containing 2+ cations, twice as many negatively charged
electrons are present to balance the charge.
In a metal structure, billions of metal atoms are held together by
metallic bonding in a giant metallic lattice.
A Figure 2 Metallic bonding
Properties of metals
Most metals have:
strong metallic bonds - attraction between positive ions and
delocalised electrons
high electrical conductivity
• high melting and boiling points.
The physical properties of metals can be explained in terms of the
giant structure of the lattice and metallic bonding.
Electrical conductivity
Metals conduct electricity in solid and liquid states. When a voltage is
applied across a metal, the delocalised electrons can move through the
structure, carrying charge, as shown in Figure 3. Contrast this ability
with the conductivity of ionic compounds, which have no mobile
charge carriers in the solid state.
Figure 3 Metal conductivity - all
the delocalised electrons will move
towards the positive terminal whilst
the negative terminal donates
electrons that move into the structure
Melting and boiling points
Most metals have high melting and boiling points. In Figure 4
coloured shading is used to compare the melting points of the
transition metals. Tungsten, W. has the highest melting point at
3422°C, which is why it is used in the filaments of halogen lamps;
other metals would melt. In contrast, mercury, Hg, melts at -39°C.
Other metals that melt at low temperatures include those in Group 1
of the periodic table, which all have melting points below 200°C.

Figure 4 Comparison of the melting points of transition metals
The melting point depends on the strength of the metallic bonds
holding together the atoms in the giant metallic lattice.
For most metals, high temperatures are necessary to provide
the large amount of energy needed to overcome the strong
electrostatic attraction between the cations and electrons.
This strong attraction results in most metals having high
melting and boiling points.
Solubility
Metals do not dissolve. It might be expected that there would be some
interaction between polar solvents and the charges in a metallic lattice,

7.3 Periodic trends in bonding
and structure

RO
Metals and non-metals
One of the key trends in the periodic table is the change from metals
to non-metals from left to right across each period. The changeover
from metal to non-metal takes place on a diagonal line from the top
of Group 13 (3) to the bottom of Group 17 (7) (Figure 1). Elements
near to the metal/non-metal divide (e.g., boron, B, silicon, Si,
germanium, Ge, arsenic, As, and antimony, Sb) can show in-between
properties and are called semi-metals or metalloids.
Going down these groups, there is a trend from non-metal to metal.
The divide is clearest in Group 14 (4), carbon (non-metal) to lead
(metal). The two elements on either side of the divide, silicon and
germanium, are semi-metals.
There are far more metallic than non-metallic elements - 92 metals to
22 non-metals. However, despite being in a minority in the periodic
table, non-metals are extremely important, especially the elements
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen in organic chemistry and
biochemistry.

Metallic bonding, structures, and properties
At room temperature, all metals except mercury are solids. The 92
known metals have a wide range of properties - some are strong
and hard like tungsten, W, some soft like lead, Pb, some light like
aluminium, Al, and some very heavy like osmium, Os, which is twice
as dense as lead.
The one constant property of all metals is their ability to conduct
electricity. This is a remarkable property for a solid, as charge must be
able to move within a rigid structure for conduction to take place.

Metallic bonding and structure
You have already met two main types of chemical bonding - ionic and
covalent. Metallic bonding is a special type of bonding for metals.
A Figure 1 The division between
metals and non-metals in the p-block
of the periodic table. The blue elements
are metals and the yellow elements are
non-metals
In a solid metal structure, each atom has donated its negative
outer-shell electrons to a shared pool of electrons, which are
delocalised (spread out) throughout the whole structure.
The positive ions (cations) left behind consist of the nucleus and
the inner electron shells of the metal atoms.
Metallic bonding is the strong electrostatic attraction between cations
(positive ions) and delocalised electrons (see Figure 2).
The cations are fixed in position, maintaining the structure and
shape of the metal.
The delocalised electrons are mobile and are able to move
throughout the structure. Only the electrons move.

The old numbers are the numbers that you used at
GCSE. Groups 1–7 and then 0. This system is based
on the s- and p-blocks. The advantage of the old
numbering is that the group number matches the
number of electrons in the highest energy electron shell.
The new numbers run from 1-18, numbering each
column in the s-, d-, and p-blocks sequentially. The
new numbers were approved for use by IUPAC in
1988, but it can take many years for old practices to
change. Your periodic table uses both numbers with
