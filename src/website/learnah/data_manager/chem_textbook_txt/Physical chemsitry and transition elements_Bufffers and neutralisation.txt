BUFFERS AND NEUTRALISATION
When the base is first added, the acid is in great excess and the pH
increases very slightly. As the vertical section is approached, the pH
starts to increase more quickly as the acid is used up more quickly.
Eventually, the pH increases rapidly during addition of a very small
volume of base, producing the vertical section. Only drops of solution
will be needed for the whole vertical section.
After the vertical section, the pH will rise very slightly as the base is
now in great excess.

The equivalence point of the titration is the volume of one
solution that exactly reacts with the volume of the other solution.
The solutions have then exactly reacted with one another and the
amounts used matching the stoichiometry of the reaction. The
equivalence point is the centre of the vertical section of the pH
titration curve.

The titration curve may be a different shape for combinations of
acid and base with different strengths. These curves and shapes are
discussed later in this topic and you will see how the shape helps in
choosing a suitable indicator for a titration.
Adding an acid to a base
A pH titration curve can also be plotted with the acid added from the
burette to the base in the flask. The shape is essentially the same, just
the other way around, going from high pH to low pH (Figure 3).

The pK, for the carbonic acid-hydrogencarbonate equilibrium is

healthy blood at a pH of 7.40?
Step 1: Express HCO,-/H,Co, in terms of K, and [H*(aq)].

K = 10-pka = 10-6.1 = 7.9 x 10-7 moldm-3
Step 3: Calculate the HCO,-/H,C0, ratio.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
You have already learnt a method for calculating pH using K. [HA (aq)], and
[A-(aq)]. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is an alternative way of
calculating the pH of a buffer solution that allows you to really see how pk
and the base/acid ratio control the pH:
[A-(aq)]
pH = pk + log
[HA(aq)]
In the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, it is easy to appreciate the effect of
the base/acid concentration ratio. When the acid and base concentrations are
the same:

and log 1 = 0

Controlling blood pH
Buffer solutions are widespread in living systems. The well-being of
the human body relies on precise pH control with different parts of the
body requiring specific pH values for effective functioning. Enzymes
are particularly sensitive and each has an optimum pH. The role of pH
control in the body falls to buffer solutions, for example, in the plasma
of the blood.

Blood plasma needs to be maintained at a pH between 7.35 and 7.45
The pH is controlled by a mixture of buffers, with the carbonic

alkalosis, which can cause muscle spasms, light-headedness, and
nausea.

Remember that pH is a sensitive scale - a difference of just 0.30 pH
units is a two-fold difference in H+(aq) concentration. So although
7.40 + 0.30 (i.e. 7.10 - 7.70), does not sound very different from
the healthy blood pH of 7.40, the difference is very large in terms of
acidity or alkalinity.

Two reservoirs to remove added acid and alkali
In the ethanoic acid equilibrium, the equilibrium position lies well
towards ethanoic acid. When CH,COO ions are added to CH COOH,
the equilibrium position shifts even further to the left, reducing the
already small concentration of H+(aq) ions, and leaving a solution
containing mainly the two components, CH,COOH and CH COO:
CH,COOH(aq) = H(aq) + CH,COO-(aq)

CH,COOH and CH COO act as two reservoirs that are able to act
independently to remove added acid and alkali. This is achieved by
shifting the buffer's equilibrium system either to the right or left.
Action of the buffer solution
The conjugate acid-base pair, HA(aq)/A (aq), in an acid buffer solution
controls the pH. The equilibrium is shown below.
HA(aq) = H+(aq) + A-(aq)
The control of pH can be explained in terms of shifts in the

21.1 Buffer solutions
Specification reference: 5.1.3
What is a buffer solution?
A buffer solution is a system that minimises pH changes when small
amounts of an acid or a base are added. Buffer solutions contain
two components to remove added acid or alkali – a weak acid (as
component l) and its conjugate base (as component 2).
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
→ buffer solutions
→ preparing buffer solutions
► the role of acid-base pairs in

→ calculating the pH of buffer

The weak acid, HA, removes added alkali.
The conjugate base, A-, removes added acid.
When alkalis and acids are added to a buffer, the two components
in the buffer solution react and will eventually be used up. As soon
as one component has all reacted, the solution loses its buffering
ability towards added acid or alkalis. As the buffer works, the pH
does change but only by a small amount - you should not assume
that the pH stays completely constant.

Preparing weak acid buffer solutions
A buffer solution based on a weak acid needs a weak acid and its
conjugate base. Two methods for preparing a buffer based on ethanoic
acid are outlined below.
Preparation from a weak acid and its salt
A buffer solution can be prepared by mixing a solution of ethanoic
acid, CH2COOH, with a solution of one of its salts, for example,
sodium ethanoate, CH,COONa.
When ethanoic acid is added to water, the acid partially dissociates and
the amount of ethanoate ions in solution is very small. Ethanoic acid is
the source of the weak acid component of the buffer solution.
CH,COOH(aq) = H+ (aq) + CH,C00-(aq)

dissolving ionic compounds,
see Topic 5.2 lonic bonding and
structure, Topic 22.2, Enthalpy
changes in solution, and Topic
22.3, Factors affecting lattice
enthalpy and hydration.
Salts of weak acids are ionic compounds and provide a convenient
source of the conjugate base. When added to water, the salt
completely dissolves. Dissociation into ions is complete and so the salt
is the source of the conjugate base component of the buffer solution.

Preparation by partial neutralisation of the weak acid
A buffer solution can also be prepared by adding an aqueous solution
of an alkali, such as NaOH(aq), to an excess of the weak acid. The
weak acid is partially neutralised by the alkali, forming the conjugate

BUFFERS AND NEUTRALISATION
Although the equation appears more complex than the method you have
learnt, the calculation is often easier. For a buffer solution containing
0.100 mol dm-3 CH2COOH (pK = 4.76) and 0.300 mol dm-3CH,COONa, the
pH can be solved in a single step:
[CH,COO-(aq)] - 476+100 0.300
pH = pk + log
[CH,COOH(aq)]
0.100
= 4.76 + log 3 = 4.76 +0.48
= 5.24
Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pH of the
following buffer solutions.
a 0.250 mol dm-3 HCOOH and 0.750 mol dm-3 HCOONa
(PK HCOOH = 3.75)
b 0.800 mol dm-3 HOCH,COOH and 0.400 moldm-3 HOCH,COONa
(PK HOCH,COOH = 3.83)
c 0.475 mol dm-CH,CHOHCOOH and 0.625 mol dm "CH,CHOHCOONa
(pK CH CHOHCOOH = 3.08)

pH titration curves
Acid-base titrations use indicators to monitor neutralisation reactions
accurately. The results can then be analysed to find out some unknown
information about the acid or base. This topic looks closely at the pH
changes that take place during a titration. A pH meter can be used for
monitoring these changes as outlined below.
Synoptic link
Look back to Topic 4.2, Acid-base
titrations.
Using a pH meter
ApH meter consists of an electrode, that is dipped into a solution, and
connected to a meter that displays the pH reading. A pH meter typically
records pH values to two decimal places. Indicator paper is usually matched
from colour charts to the nearest whole number, so a pH meter is able to
give more accurate measurements of pH during a titration. The procedure
below monitors the pH as an aqueous base is added to an acid solution.
1 Using a pipette, add a measured volume of acid to a conical flask.
2 Place the electrode of the pH meter in the flask.
3 Add the aqueous base to the burette and add to the acid in the conical
flask, 1 cm at a time.
After each addition, swirl the contents. Record the pH and the total
volume of the aqueous base added.
5 Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the pH starts to change more rapidly. Then
add the aqueous base dropwise for each reading until the pH changes
less rapidly.
6 Now add the aqueous base 1 cm at a time again until an excess has
been added and the pH has been basic, with little change, for several
additions.
A graph of pH against total volume of aqueous base added is then plotted.
Figure 2 shows the curve for a titration between 0.1 mol dm-3 solutions of a
strong monobasic acid and a strong monobasic base.
For an alternative automatic method, you could attach the pH meter to a
datalogger and use a magnetic stirrer in the flask. The aqueous base would
then be added from the burette to the flask slowly, and the pH titration
curve could be plotted automatically using the datalogger or appropriate
software on a computer.
A Figure 1 A student using a digital pH
meter to measure the pH of a solution
in a conical flask during an acid-base
titration
A pH meter records a pH as 4.65 but the best match with indicator paper
is a pH of 5. Calculate the (H+(aq)] concentration at each pH reading and
estimate the percentage error in pH and [H(aq)] made by measuring the
pH with indicator paper.
