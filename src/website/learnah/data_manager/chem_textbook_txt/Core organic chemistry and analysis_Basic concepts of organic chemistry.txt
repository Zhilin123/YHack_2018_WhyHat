Displayed formula
A displayed formula shows the relative positioning of all of the atoms
in a molecule and the bonds between them.
Study tip
When using the general formula for
an alcohol you have to be careful-
the general formula is C H2OH,
but the molecular formula is
CH2n+20.
1-Bromobutane has the molecular formula C,H,Br. Its displayed

to show the arrangement of the atoms in a molecule. It shows clearly
which groups are bonded together. For example, the structural
formula of butane, is CH CH CH CH, or CH (CH2)2CHz.

Skeletal formula
A skeletal formula is a simplified organic formula. You remove:
all of the carbon and hydrogen labels from carbon chains
any bonds to hydrogen atoms.
This leaves just a carbon skeleton and any functional groups.
In skeletal formulae:
a line represents a single bond
an intersection of two lines represents a carbon atom
the end of a line represents a -CH, group.

Chemical formulae
Different types of formula are used in organic chemistry. For
example, in the previous topic some molecules were drawn as
displayed formulae, with every atom and every bond shown, to give
a clear picture of how the atoms are bonded together in a molecule.
You already know about molecular and empirical formulae. In
this topic you will learn how to show the structural, displayed, and
skeletal formulae of molecules.

Molecular formula
The molecular formula shows the number and type of atoms of each
element present in a molecule. The molecular formula does not show
how the atoms are joined together and different molecules can have
the same molecular formula.

Curly arrows and homolytic fission
You now know that the movement of a pair of electrons is shown using an
arrow with a full arrowhead. However, in some text books and on the Internet,
you may see fish-hook arrows - arrows with half of an arrow head.
A fish-hook arrow represents the movement of a single, unpaired electron
in mechanisms involving radicals. In Figure 2, a single covalent bond in
bromine is broken homolytically. Each atom takes one electron.

What is organic chemistry?
Organic chemistry was originally defined by the Swedish chemist Jöns
Jacob Berzelius as the chemistry of compounds derived from living
systems. Today about sixteen million organic compounds are known,
which is surprising since organic chemistry is only about 200 years old.
Before 1828, scientists did not believe it was possible to make organic
compounds from inorganic compounds. Many experiments were carried
out in attempts to synthesise organic compounds but all ended in failure.
In 1828, the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler accidentally synthesised
urea (Figure 1) whilst attempting to prepare ammonium cyanate from
silver cyanide and ammonium chloride. This was the first organic
synthesis carried out from inorganic compounds dispelling the myth
that only living organisms could produce organic compounds.
C-NH2
H2N
A Figure 1 The chemical structure
of urea, a compound found in living
organisms. It is a common fertiliser
that was the first organic material
synthesised in the laboratory
Modern organic chemistry studies the structure, properties, composition,
reactions, and preparation of carbon-containing compounds. Organic
compounds are vital in every area of modern life: pharmaceuticals,
detergents, dyes and pigments, cosmetics, plastics, and agricultural
chemicals are all organic compounds - they all contain the element
carbon. Today, the vast majority of the organic materials used are
produced from fractions of crude oil as fuels in domestic central heating
systems, for electrical generation, and to power many forms of transport.
Synoptic link
You have met the idea of a covalent
bond as a shared pair of electrons
in Topic 5.3, Covalent bonding.
Why is carbon so special?
Carbon is in Group 14(4) of the periodic table, with four electrons
in its outer shell. Each carbon atom can form four covalent bonds
to other atoms. These can be single, double, and even triple bonds.
Carbon atoms can bond to other carbon atoms to form long chains.
Hydrocarbons
A hydrocarbon is a compound containing carbon and hydrogen
only. The hydrocarbons methane, but-2-ene, and propyne are shown
in Figure 3.

Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,

→ the terms alkyl, aliphatic,
alicyclic, and aromatic
► the general formula of a
homologous series
→ IUPAC rules of nomenclature
for organic compounds.
Naming hydrocarbons
As there are so many organic compounds a universal system of
naming organic molecules is needed to keep track of them all. IUPAC
is an organisation that was founded in 1919 by chemists from industry
and education who recognised the need for standardisation of the
names of compounds. This means that chemists across the globe can
communicate clearly.
Hydrocarbons can be classified as:
aliphatic - carbon atoms are joined to each other in unbranched
(straight) or branched chains
alicyclic - carbon atoms are joined to each other in ring (cyclic)
structures
aromatic - some or all of the carbon atoms are found in a
benzene ring.

Stem, prefix, and suffix
The stem of the name indicates the number of carbon atoms in the
longest continuous chain in the molecule.
A prefix can be added before the stem, often to indicate the
presence of side chains or a functional groups.
• A suffix is added after the stem to indicate functional groups.
aromatic

alicyclic, and aromatic hydrocarbon
Naming aliphatic alkanes
Follow these steps when naming alkanes:
1 All alkanes have the suffix -ane.
2 Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms (the parent'
chain) and name it from Table 1.
Identify any side chains attached to the parent chain. These
side chains are known as alkyl groups. An alkyl group has a
hydrogen atom removed from an alkane parent chain. The name
of the alkyl group (from Table 1) is added as a prefix to the name
of the parent chain.
4 Add numbers before any alkyl groups to show the position of the
alkyl groups on the parent chain.

Saturated and unsaturated
Hydrocarbons can be saturated or unsaturated.
A saturated hydrocarbon has single bonds only, as shown in the
structure of methane.
An unsaturated hydrocarbon contains carbon-to-carbon multiple
bonds, as shown in the structures but-2-ene and propyne.
Homologous series
Carbon compounds are so numerous that it is convenient to organise
them into families of compounds with similar chemical structures
and properties. A homologous series is a family of compounds with
similar chemical properties whose successive members differ by the
addition of a -CH2-group.
The simplest homologous series is the alkanes. Alkanes contain
single carbon-to-carbon bonds. The first three members of the
homologous series of the alkanes are shown in Figure 4.

Functional groups
A functional group is the part of the organic molecule that is largely
responsible for the molecule's chemical properties. In addition to
hydrogen, carbon can bond to other elements, including oxygen,
nitrogen, and halogens. This results in the formation of molecules
containing different functional groups, such as alcohol and amine
groups (Figure 5).

11.5 Introduction to reaction
mechanisms
Specification reference: 4.1.1
Types of bond fission
A covalent bond is defined as a shared pair of electrons between two
atoms. When a chemical reaction takes place, bonds in the reactants
break and new bonds are formed in the products. Covalent bonds
can be broken by either homolytic fission or heterolytic fission.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
→ homolytic and heterolytic
bond fission
→ curly arrows and reaction
mechanisms
addition, substitution, and
elimination reactions.
Homolytic fission
When a covalent bond breaks by homolytic fission, each of the bonded
atoms takes one of the shared pair of electrons from the bond.
•
Each atom now has a single unpaired electron.
An atom or groups of atoms with an unpaired electron is called a
radical.
Synoptic link
You will study homolytic fission
reactions and radicals in more
depth in Chapter 12.
The homolytic fission of the carbon-carbon bond in ethane is shown
in the equation below:
H,C-CH, H,C• + .CH,
radicals
Heterolytic fission
When a covalent bond breaks by heterolytic fission, one of the bonded
atoms takes both of the electrons from the bond.
The atom that takes both electrons becomes a negative ion.
The atom that does not take the electrons becomes a positive ion.
The heterolytic fission of the carbon-chlorine bond in chloromethane,
CH,CI, is shown in the equation below.
H,C-Cl → H,C+ + Cl-
ions
Organic reaction mechanisms
An equation tells you about the reactants, products, and stoichiometry
of a reaction, but it does not provide any information about how
the reaction takes place. This process is known as the reaction
mechanism.
heterolytic fission
Curly arrows
In a reaction mechanism, curly arrows are used to show the
movement of electron pairs when bonds are being broken or made.
The heterolytic fission of a carbon-chlorine bond in a haloalkane is
shown in Figure 1. Both the bonded electrons go to the chlorine atom
to form a positive ion and a negative ion.

11.4 Isomerism
Specification reference: 4.1.1
The same molecular formula can often apply to different compounds.
Different compounds with the same molecular formula are known
as isomers. There are several types of isomers. This topic looks at
structural isomerism.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
structural isomerism
► determination of possible
structural formulae from a
molecular formula.
Structural isomerism
Structural isomers are compounds with the same molecular
formula but different structural formulae.
Many examples of structural isomerism occur in the alkane
homologous series. Different structures of C,H,, were shown in
Figure 4 in Topic 11.3. Similarly, the molecular formula C,H, does not
unambiguously identify the structure of the molecule. There are two
possible structural isomers that can be drawn for C H (Figure 1).

Isomers with the same functional group
In compounds containing a functional group, the functional group
can be at different positions along the carbon chain. The two possible
structural isomers of C,H,Cl are shown in Figure 2.
B Worked example: Branching alcohols
Draw the skeletal formulae of the four structural isomers that are
alcohols and have the molecular formula C,H,0.
Remember that structural isomers can be formed by changing
both the position of the functional group and the branching of
the carbon chain.
Step 1: Draw out the different ways that four carbons can be
connected in aliphatic chains.
Step 2: Add the -OH group in different positions to create all the
possible isomers that are alcohols (Figure 3).

The four isomers of C,H,O will be
important later in your study of
organic chemistry when you come
to look at the classification of the
alcohols (Topic 14.1, Properties
of alcohols) and their oxidation
reactions (Topic 14.2, Reactions
of alcohols).

Naming alicylic alkanes
For cyclic alkanes, the same rules apply as when naming aliphatic
alkanes. The prefix cyclo- in front of the stem is used to show that
the carbon atoms are arranged in a ring structure.

Study tip
As you get used to naming
molecules, you won't need to go
follow a step-by-step procedure.
Naming alkenes
Alkenes are named using the same rules as for alkanes, except the
suffix is -ene. The position of the C=C bond in the chain must be
stated for alkenes that have four or more carbon atoms in the longest
chain.

Step 2: Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms.
There are five carbon atoms in the chain so the stem is pent-.
Step 3: Identify where the double bond is.
The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Only the smaller
number is needed to indicate the position of the double bond, so
we use 2- only.
Step 4: Combine the suffix, stem, and position of the double
bond to name the compound.
The compound is called pent-2-ene.

Figure 2 2,2-dimethylbutane
O Worked example: Naming branched alkanes
How do you work out the IUPAC name of the compound in Figure 2?
Step 1: Identify which suffix to use.
The compound is an alkane so the suffix is -ane.
Step 2: Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms
The longest continuous chain contains four carbon atoms so the
stem name is but-.
Step 3: Identify any side chains and which number carbon the side
chains are on.
There are two side chains - each is a methyl group.
The side chain can be considered to be on carbon 2 or carbon 3,
depending on which end the counting starts from (Figure 2). When
naming compounds, always use the lowest combination of numbers
possible, so use 2- instead of 3-.
Step 4: Combine the suffix, stem, and side chains to name the
compound.
When two or more side chains are the same, the prefixes di-, tri-, or
tetra- are used, corresponding to two, three, or four of the same side
chain respectively.
The compound is 2,2-dimethylbutane.
Sometimes it is difficult to identify the longest chain. When there are
two or more possible chains of the same length in a molecule,
the chain with most branches is considered the longest chain.
Figure 3 shows a molecule that seems to have two different chains
containing six carbon atoms, coloured pink and blue. The pink chain
has three branches but the blue chain only has two. So, the pink chain
is the parent chain.

Cyclic and aromatic compounds
One of the most common uses of skeletal formulae is in representing
alicyclic and aromatic compounds, such as cyclohexane, cyclohexene,
and benzene (Figures 7 and 8). The skeletal formula
of benzene, C H, can be represented in two different ways.

Molecules containing functional groups
When functional groups are present in a molecule, they must be
included in the skeletal formula.
In Figure 9 the skeletal formula for 2-chlorobut-l-ene is shown on the
left. The double bond between carbon atoms 1 and 2 is represented by
two parallel lines. The chlorine atom is shown on carbon 2, and the
carbon and hydrogen atoms in the carbon skeleton are unlabelled.
In Figure 9 the skeletal formula on the right is 2-methylpentan-3-one.
Notice how the ketone functional group and the methyl group are
represented in a skeletal formula.
