CHROMATOGRAPHY AND SPECTROSCOPY
The worked example for aromatic isomers shows just how useful
carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy can be. The structures are so similar that
it would be very difficult to distinguish between them by other means.
But from the carbon-13 NMR spectra, you just need to count the
number of peaks. It may not always be as easy and you may find that
different isomers give the same number of peaks, but you can often
identify some of the isomers using this technique.
Further analysis of a carbon-13 NMR spectrum
The carbon-13 NMR spectrum of propan-1-ol is shown
in Figure 4 with the three peaks for the three carbon
environments labelled.
HO V
Carbon-2 is closer than carbon-3 to the oxygen atom
connected to carbon-1. The proximity of an electronegative
atom or multiple bond is an important factor in shifting a
peak to a higher d value. You saw this idea in the spectrum
of propanal earlier in this topic.
This prediction agrees with the actual NMR spectrum, but
you do need to be very careful as other factors such as
concentration and interactions with the solvent may also
affect the chemical shift.

of peaks and the order of peaks for the following

50-90 ppm, but carbon atoms 2 and 3 both match the
same C—C environment in the range 0-50 ppm. So how
do you know that the peaks are this way round?

Step 6: Combine the information to suggest a structure.
From the evidence, the CH.CH, group could be adjacent to either a

Proton NMR spectroscopy
A proton NMR spectrum provides four important pieces of information
about a molecule. Firstly, the spectrum provides similar information to
a carbon-13 NMR spectrum but for protons:
• the number of different proton environments - from the number of
peaks
• the types of proton environments present - from the chemical shift.
There are the two extra pieces of information:
the relative numbers of each type of proton - from integration traces
or ratio numbers of the relative peak areas
. the number of non-equivalent protons adjacent to a given proton -
from the spin-spin splitting pattern.
Figure 1 shows chemical shift values for protons in different
environments. The chemical shift 8 is referenced against TMS at
8 = 0 ppm. The chemical shift range of about 12 ppm is much
narrower than the carbon-13 range of about 220 ppm.

Specification reference: 6.3.1

Chromatography is used to separate individual components from
a mixture of substances. All forms of chromatography have a
stationary phase and a mobile phase.

The stationary phase does not move and is normally a solid or a
liquid supported on a solid.
The mobile phase does move, and is normally a liquid or a gas.
Chromatography can be used in the analysis of drugs, plastics,
flavourings, air samples, and has applications in forensic science.
.
Thin layer chromatography (TLC)
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is a quick and inexpensive analytical
technique that indicates how many components are in a mixture. The
technique uses a TLC plate which is usually a plastic sheet or glass,
coated with a thin layer of a solid adsorbent substance - usually silica.
In TLC, the adsorbent is the stationary phase. The different
components in the mixture have different affinities for the absorbent
and bind with differing strengths to its surface. Adsorption is the
process by which the solid silica holds the different substances in the
mixture to its surface. Separation is achieved by the relative adsorptions
of substances with the stationary phase
* Carrying out TLC
1 Take a TLC plate. Using a pencil, draw a line across the plate about 1 cm
from one end of the plate. This is the base line.
2 Using a capillary tube, spot a small amount of a solution of the sample
onto the base line on the plate.
Prepare a chromatography tank for the TLC plate. This can be made from
a small beaker with a watch glass placed on the top. Pour some solvent
into the beaker to a depth of about 0.5 cm.
Place the prepared TLC plate in the beaker, making sure that the solvent
does not cover the spot. Cover the beaker with the watch glass and
leave it undisturbed on the bench. The solvent will rise up the TLC plate
(Figure 1).

29.4 Proton NMR spectroscopy
Spin-spin coupling
So far, you can see that a proton NMR spectrum reveals a large amount
of information about the structure of molecules. A proton NMR peak
can also be split into sub-peaks or splitting patterns. These are caused
by the proton's spin interacting with the spin states of nearby protons
that are in different environments. This provides information about the
number of protons bonded to adjacent carbon atoms.
Then + 1 rule
Study tip
Spin-spin splitting occurs only if
adjacent protons are in a different
environment from the protons
being split. Refer back to the section
on equivalent and non-equivalent
protons, earlier in this topic.
The splitting of a main peak into sub-peaks is called spin-spin
coupling or spin-spin splitting, and the number of sub-peaks is one
greater than the number of adjacent protons causing the splitting. This
sounds complicated but the pattern is easy to see using the n + 1 rule.
For a proton with n protons attached to an adjacent carbon atom,
the number of sub-peaks in a splitting pattern = 1 + 1
When analysing spin-spin splitting, you are really seeing the number
of hydrogen atoms on the immediately adjaceni carbon atom. The
possible splittings for different sequences of protons in an organic
molecule are shown in Table 1.

The patterns shown above are very common in NMR spectra. This
degree of splitting continues with more adjacent protons. Another
common pattern is for CH(CHZ), where a CH proton has six protons
on the adjacent carbon atoms. This gives the heptet (7) splitting
pattern shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5 Heptet splitting of the
CH group in CH(CH), caused by six
adjacent protons in the two CH, groups
Study tip
You will not need to interpret
more complex splitting beyond
observing a multiplet.
More complex splitting
In CH(CH2), above, the two CH, groups are in the same environment.
Sometimes, adjacent protons may have different environments. In
molecules such as CH CH,CH,COOH, the central -CH - would be split
differently by the CH, and CH, protons. The resulting splitting would
then show as a multiplet. More advanced work allows multiplets to
be analysed.

A Figure 5 The inside of a gas
chromatograph showing the copper
column wound into a coil
A small amount of the volatile mixture is injected into the apparatus,
called a gas chromatograph. The mobile carrier gas carries the
components in the sample through the capillary column which
contains the liquid stationary phase absorbed onto the solid support.
The components slow down as they interact with the liquid stationary
phase inside the column. The more soluble the component is in the liquid
stationary phase, the slower it moves through the capillary column.
The components of the mixture are separated depending on their
solubility in the liquid stationary phase. The compounds in the
mixture reach the detector at different times depending on their
interactions with the stationary phase in the column. The compound
retained in the column for the shortest time has the lowest retention
time and is detected first. The retention time is the time taken for
each component to travel through the column.
Interpretation of a gas chromatogram
Each component is detected as a peak on the gas chromatogram. Two
pieces of information can be obtained from a gas chromatogram.
Retention times can be used to identify the components present
in the sample by comparing these to retention times for known
components.
Peak integrations (the areas under each peak) can be used to
determine the concentrations of components in the sample.

5 Allow the solvent to rise up the plate until it is about
1 cm below the top of the plate. Remove the plate
from the beaker and immediately mark the solvent
front with a pencil. Allow the plate to dry.
6 If there are any visible spots, circle them with a
pencil. Alternatively hold a UV lamp over the plate and
circle any spots that you can see. Sometimes the
plate is sprayed with a chemical or a locating agent,
such as iodine, to show the position of the spots that
may be invisible to the naked eye.

Interpretation of a TLC plate
Thin layer chromatograms are analysed by calculating the value for
the retention factor R for each component. Each component can be
identified by comparing its R value with known values recorded using
the same solvent system, and absorbent.
To calculate the R, value you use the formula:
distance moved by the component
T distance moved by the solvent front

CHROMATOGRAPHY AND SPECTROSCOPY
Equivalent and non-equivalent protons
For carbon-13 NMR, you saw that carbon atoms in the same chemical
environment absorb at the same chemical shift value. These carbon
atoms are equivalent to one another. For proton NMR, the same
principle applies:
• If two or more protons are equivalent, they will absorb at the same
chemical shift, increasing the size of the peak.
Protons of different types have different chemical environments
and are non-equivalent - they absorb at different chemical shifts.
A good way of visualising equivalent and non-equivalent protons is to
look for any plane of symmetry. The examples below show different
molecules containing more than one CH, group.

plane of symmetry between the two CH, group and the protons in the
two CH, groups are equivalent. There are two proton environments
giving two peaks in total:
one peak for the two equivalent COOH protons
one peak for the four equivalent protons in the two CH, groups.
The proton NMR spectrum therefore has two peaks, one with twice
the area of the other.

Relative numbers of each type of proton
In a carbon-13 NMR spectrum, the peak area is not directly
related to the number of carbon atoms responsible for the
peak. This all changes for proton NMR - the ratio of the
relative areas under each peak gives the ratio of the number
of protons responsible for each peak.
The NMR spectrometer measures the area under each peak
as an integration trace (mathematically, integration means
the area under a curve). The integration trace is shown
either as an extra line on the spectrum or as a printed
number of the relative peak areas. This provides invaluable
information for identifying an unknown compound.
The proton NMR spectra of methyl chloroethanoate,
CICH,COOCH,, shows an integration trace (the blue line)
in the peak area ratio of 2 : 3 for the two protons in CH, and
three protons in CH, (Figure 4).

NMR spectroscopy
Since its invention about 70 years ago, nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has revolutionised the analysis of
organic compounds. The technique uses a combination of a very
strong magnetic field and radio frequency radiation. With the right
combination of magnetic field strength and frequency, the nuclei of
some atoms absorb this radiation. The energy for the absorption can
be measured and recorded as an NMR spectrum.
Synoptic link
See Topic 5.1, Electron structure,
for details of electron spin.
What is nuclear magnetic resonance?
Nuclear spin
You will remember that electrons have a property called spin. The
nucleus also has a nuclear spin, that is significant if there is an
odd number of nucleons (protons and neutrons). Almost all organic
molecules contain carbon and hydrogen, mostly as the 'H and 12C
isotopes, with a small proportion (1.1%) of the BC isotope. So for the
organic chemist, NMR is relevant for 'Hand 13C, the isotopes with an
odd number of nucleons.
NMR spectroscopy can be used to detect isotopes of other elements
with odd numbers of nucleons, such as 1°F and 31P. However 13C and
especially 'H NMR spectroscopy are the commonest forms of analysis
used. As a 'H nucleus consists of just a proton, 'H NMR is usually
referred to as proton NMR.
Resonance
An electron has two different spin states. The nucleus also has two
different spin states and these have different energies. With the right
combination of a strong magnetic field and radio frequency radiation,
the nucleus can absorb energy and rapidly flips between the two spin
states. This is called resonance and the whole process gives the name
'nuclear magnetic resonance'.
The NMR spectrometer
Radio frequency radiation has much less energy than the infrared
radiation used in IR spectroscopy. The frequency required for
resonance is proportional to the magnetic field strength and it is
only in strong and uniform magnetic fields that this small quantity
of energy can be detected. Typically a very strong super-conducting
electromagnet is used, cooled to 4 K by liquid helium.
Figure 1 shows a typical NMR spectrometer. You can see the large
cylinder which houses the electromagnet, cooled by liquid helium.
For organic chemistry, most routine spectrometers operate at

29.3 Carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy
Carbon-13 NMR spectra for propanal and propanone
Propanal and propanone are structural isomers of C,H,O. Propanal
and propanone produce different 13C NMR spectra. The NMR spectra
and the reasons for the difference are described below.
1 Propanal, CH CH CHO
There are three carbon atoms and these are clearly in three different
environments as shown below.
Carbon-1 is part of the CHO functional group.
Carbon-2 is part of a CH, group between a
CH, group and an aldehyde group.
Carbon-3 is part of a CH group bonded to
CH,CHO.
I-
H-CZ
2 Propanone, CH COCH,
There are three carbo atoms but only two different environments as
shown below.
Carbon-1 is part of the C=0 group.
The other two carbon atoms, both labelled 2,
have the same environment. They are
positioned symmetrically and can both be
described in an identical way - each carbon
atom is part of a CH, group bonded to COCH,
The carbon-13 NMR spectra for propanal and propanone are shown
below. The peaks have been identified from the chemical shift values

into the same broad C-C environment as carbon-3 (CH), it is nearer
to the oxygen atom connected to carbon-1 so it is likely to be shifted
more than carbon-3.

Carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy
A carbon-13 NMR spectrum provides two important pieces of
information about a molecule:
the number of different carbon environments - from the number
of peaks
the types of carbon environment present - from the chemical shift.
Figure 1 shows chemical shift values for carbon atoms in different
environments. The chemical shift 8 is referenced against TMS at
d = 0 ppm. The chemical shift range of about 220 ppm is sufficiently
wide to separate carbon atoms that have only slightly different
environments.

Figure 1 Carbon-13 NMR chemical shifts
Study tip
You do not need to memorise the
chemical shifts of different groups
as you will be provided with them
on the Data Sheet.
There are four main types of carbon atom that absorb over different
chemical shift ranges, as shown by the labels below the chemical
shift axis. The chemical shifts may also be outside of these ranges,
depending on the solvent, concentration, and substituents.
The chemical environment of a carbon atom is determined by the
position of the atom within the molecule.
• Carbon atoms that are bonded to different atoms or groups of
atoms have different environments and will absorb at different
chemical shifts.
If two carbon atoms are positioned symmetrically within a
molecule, then they are equivalent and have the same chemical
environment. They will then absorb radiation at the same
chemical shift and contribute to the same peak.

Step 4: Combine the information to suggest a structure.
Combining the evidence from Steps 1-3, the correct
structure is CH,CH,COOCH, (methyl propanoate), which

chemical shift/ppm
Step 1: Analyse the types of proton present and how many of
each type.
There are two peaks so there are two types of proton.
• From the relative peak areas, the ratio of types of protons is 1 : 6.
• So the peaks are 3.8 ppm CH and 1.6 ppm 2 x CH,
Step 2: Analyse the splitting patterns to find information about
adjacent protons.
The heptet at 3.8 ppm indicates 6 H atoms on adjacent
C atoms by the n+1 rule (6 + 1 = 7) which must be two CH,
groups as (CH3)2.
The doublet at 1.6 ppm indicates an adjacent CH by the n+1
rule (1 + 1 = 2).
The combination of a doublet at 8 = 1.6 ppm and a heptet
at 8 = 3.8 ppm indicates CH(CH2)2.

Deuterated solvents
Molecules of most common solvents contain carbon and hydrogen
atoms, which will produce a signal in both 13C and H NMR spectra.
A deuterated solvent is usually used in which the 'H atoms have been
replaced by 2H atoms (deuterium, D). Deuterium produces no NMR
signal in the frequency ranges used in 'Hand BC NMR spectroscopy.
Deuterated trichloromethane, CDC1, is commonly used as a solvent
in NMR spectroscopy, but this will still produce a peak in a carbon-13
NMR spectrum. The computer usually filters out this peak before
displaying the spectrum.

Chemical shift and TMS
In an organic molecule, every carbon and hydrogen atom is bonded to
other atoms. All atoms have electrons surrounding the nucleus, which
shifts the energy and radio frequency needed for nuclear magnetic
resonance to takes place. The frequency shift is measured on a scale
called chemical shift , in units of parts per million (ppm).
Tetramethylsilane (TMS), (CH), Si, is used as the standard reference
chemical against which all chemical shifts are measured. TMS is given
a chemical shift value of 0 ppm.
The amount of chemical shift is determined by chemical environment,
especially the presence of nearby electronegative atoms (Figure 3).

So depending on the chemical environment, nuclear magnetic
resonance requires a different energy and frequency, producing
absorption peaks at chemical shifts. This means that the carbon and
hydrogen arrangement in a molecule can be mapped out without
needing to carry out conventional chemical tests and without
destroying the organic compound under test.
Running the spectrum
In an NMR spectrometer, the sample is dissolved in a solvent and
placed in a narrow NMR sample tube, together with a small amount of
TMS (Figure 4).
The tube is placed inside the NMR spectrometer, where it is spun to
even out any imperfections in the magnetic field within the sample.
The spectrometer is zeroed against the TMS standard and the sample
is given a pulse of radiation containing a range of radio frequencies,
whilst maintaining a constant magnetic field. Any absorptions of energy
resulting from resonance are detected and displayed on a computer
screen (Figure 5). After analysis, the sample can be recovered by
evaporation of the solvent.

29.5 Interpreting NMR spectra
Specification reference: 6.3.2
Interpreting proton NMR spectra
There are no set rules about how to identify a compound from a proton
NMR spectrum. Although the worked examples follow a step-by-step
procedure, you can solve spectral problems in almost any order. With
one spectrum, you might start with the splitting patterns (especially with
a triplet/quartet combination), for another you might start by looking
at chemical shifts. It depends on which piece of evidence is the first that
you see and there are countless ways of solving these problems.

chemical shift/ppm
Step 1: Analyse the types of proton present and how many of
each type.
There are three peaks so there are three types of proton.
From the relative peak areas, the ratio of types of
protons is 3:2:3.
• So the peaks are 3.7 ppm CH , 2.3 ppm CH,
1.1 ppm CH2
Step 2: Analyse the splitting patterns to find information about
adjacent protons.
The singlet at 3.7 ppm indicates no adjacent H atoms
by the n + 1 rule (0 + 1 = 1).
The triplet at 1.1 ppm indicates an adjacent CH, by
the n + 1 rule (2 + 1 = 3).
The quartet at 2.3 ppm indicates an adjacent CH, by
the n + 1 rule (3 + 1 = 4).
The combination of a triplet d = 1.1 ppm and a
quartet at d = 2.3 ppm indicates CH CH.
Step 3: Using the data in Topic 29.4 Figure 1, analyse the
chemical shifts for the types of proton.
• The CH, peak at 8 = 3.7 ppm has the type H-6-0,
supporting the sequence CH-0.
The CH, peak at 8 = 2.3 ppm has the type H-C=0,
supporting the sequence CH, C=0.
The CH, peak at 8 = 1.1 ppm has the type H-C-R,
supporting the sequence CH, C.

There are four types of protons which should give four peaks.

Step 2: Use the data in Topic 29.4, Figure 1. predict the chemical
shifts.
Protons 1 are the type H-C-R, giving a peak at
8= 0.5-2.0 ppm.
• Proton 2 is the type H-C-0, giving a peak at 8 = 3.0-4.2 ppm.
• Proton 3 is the type OH, giving a peak anywhere: 8 = 0-12 ppm
• Proton 4 is the type COOH, giving a peak at d = 10–12 ppm.
Step 3: Predict the relative peak heights from the number of each
type of proton.
The relative peak heights for protons 1-4 would be 3:1:1:1
(CHZ, CH, OH, COOH)
Step 4: Predict the splitting patterns from the number of H atoms
on adjacent C atoms.
• The protons in environment I have one proton on the
adjacent C atom (i.e. CH) giving a doublet by the n + 1 rule
(3 +1 = 2).
The protons in environment 2 have three protons on the
adjacent C atom (i.e. CH,), giving a quartet by the n + 1 rule
(3 + 1 = 2).
The OH and COOH protons would give broad peaks and
would not show splitting.
Checking the prediction
The actual proton NMR spectrum of CH CHOHCOOH is shown
below, which is in good agreement with the prediction.
Notice that the quartet at d = 4.2 for the CH group is at the upper
end of our predicted chemical shift range of 3.0-4.2 ppm. If you
look at the structure, this CH group is adjacent to both an O atom
and a C=O group, two groups that increase the chemical shift.

Peak at 1710 cm-indicates the presence of a C= group in an
aldehyde, ketone or ester (cannot be a carboxylic acid as no broad
peak present at 2500-3300 cm-1 for 0—H).
Step 4: Analyse the 13C NMR spectrum.
There are 8 peaks and 8 types of carbon atom (8 carbon environments).
Step 5: Analyse the proton NMR spectrum.
Analyse the types of proton present and how many of each type.
There are four peaks so there are four types of proton.
From the relative peak areas, the ratio of protons from the left is
4:3:2:3
So the peaks are:
6.9–8.0 ppm: 4 aromatic (Ar) protons 4:3:2:3
3.8 ppm: CH, 4:3:2:3
2.6 ppm: CH, 4:3:2:3
1.2 ppm: CH, 4:3:2:3
Analyse the splitting patterns to find information about adjacent
protons.
The triplet at 1.2 ppm indicates an adjacent CH, by the n + 1 rule
(2 + 1 = 3).
The quartet at 2.6 ppm indicates an adjacent CH, by the n + 1 rule
(3 + 1 = 4).
The singlet at 3.8 ppm indicates no adjacent H atoms by the n + 1
rule (0 + 1 = 1).
The combination of a triplet 8 = 1.2 ppm and a quartet at 8 = 2.6
ppm indicates CH CH2
Use the data in Topic 29.6, Figure 1, to analyse the chemical
shifts for the types of proton.
The CH, peak at 8 = 3.8 ppm has the type 1–6–0, supporting the
sequence 0-CH.
The CH, peak at 8= 2.6 ppm has the type H-C=0 or H-C-Ar,
supporting the sequence CH2-C=O or CH2-Ar.
The CH,peak at 8 = 1.2 ppm has the type H-C-R, supporting the
sequence CH3-C.
Study tip
Look again at the aromatic protons
in the 1H NMR spectrum.
They appear to be split into two
doublets.
This splitting pattern is
characteristic of 1,4-disubstitution.
1,2 and 1,3 disubstitutions
produce more complex multiplets.
From your knowledge of splitting
patterns, you should be able to
see why.

The relative peak areas within spin-spin coupling follow
a pattern called Pascal's triangle. If you take A level
Mathematics, you may have come across this pattern.

Predict the relative peak areas in the splitting patterns
for a quintet (5), hextet (6), and heptet (7).
Spin-spin coupling occurs in pairs
In an NMR spectrum, if you see one splitting pattern there must always
be another - splitting patterns occur in pairs because each proton splits
the signal of the other. This can make it very easy to spot a structural
feature when analysing a molecule. There are several very common
splitting pairs that you may see in a spectrum and these are shown in
Figure 6 below, together with the structural feature causing the splitting.
You don't need to learn these as they can all be worked out using the

molecule.
A typical sequence for identification would include all of the
following.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
→ deduction of the structures
of organic compounds from

Synoptic link
You need to be familiar
with these techniques.
You have covered NMR
spectroscopy in this
chapter, but if you need
to revise any of the other
techniques, use the
following topics:
relative intensity
Mass spectra
Use of the molecular
ion peak to determine
the molecular mass
and fragment ions to
determine parts of the
molecule. The molecular
formula can then be
determined from the
empirical formula and
the molecular mass.

The functional groups involved include:
alcohols, ROH, phenols, ArOH, and carboxylic acids, RCOOH
• amides, RNH,, amides, RCONH,, and amino acids, RCH(NH,)COOH.
In solution, NH and OH protons may be involved in hydrogen bonding
and the NMR peaks are often broad and of variable chemical shift.
In Figure 1, you can see that OH and NH peaks can occur at almost
any chemical shift. Carboxyl COOH protons are more predictable,
absorbing at 10-12 ppm.
The broadening of the peaks also means that OH and NH protons are
not usually involved in spin-spin coupling. All this can make assigning
OH and NH protons difficult.

Proton exchange
Chemists have devised a technique called proton exchange for
identifying -OH and -NH protons:
1 A proton NMR spectrum is run as normal.
2 A small volume of deuterium oxide, D,O, is added, the mixture is
shaken and a second spectrum is run.
Deuterium exchanges and replaces the OH and NH protons in the
sample with deuterium atoms. For example, the following equilibrium
is set up with methanol:
CH,OH + D20 = CH OD + HOD
So the second spectrum is essentially being run on CH,OD. As
deuterium does not absorb in this chemical shift range, the OH peak
disappears. You can see this for methanol in Figure 7.

resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, you
came across deuterated solvents.
