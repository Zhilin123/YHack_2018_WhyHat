ALCOHOLS
Preparation of carboxylic acids
If a primary alcohol is heated strongly under reflux, with an excess of
acidified potassium dichromate(VI), a carboxylic acid is formed. Use
of an excess of the acidified potassium dichromate(VI) ensures that
all of the alcohol is oxidised. Heating under reflux ensures that any
aldehyde formed initially in the reacton also undergoes oxidation to
the carboxylic acid.
The complete oxidation of butan-1-ol to butanoic acid is shown
in Figure 3.

such as whether a reagent in excess the conditions and the technique
used, influence the product formed.

for primary alcohols.

carboxylic acid
When preparing the aldehyde, use distillation to remove the
aldehyde from the reaction mixture.
When preparing the carboxylic acid, heat the alcohol under reflux.
Oxidation of secondary alcohols
Secondary alcohols are oxidised to ketones. It is not possible to further
oxidise ketones using acidified dichromate (VI) ions.
Synoptic link
To ensure the reaction goes to completion, the secondary alcohol is
heated under reflux with the oxidising mixture. The dichromate(VI)
ions once again change colour from orange to green. The oxidation
of propan-2-ol to propanone is shown in Figure 4.
Distillation and heat under reflux
are practical techniques that you
will need to use as part of your
practical course. You will meet both

You will recall from Topic 11.5,
Introduction to reaction
mechanisms, that an elimination
reaction involves the removal of a
small molecule from a molecule,
forming two products.
Dehydration of alcohols
Dehydration is any reaction in which a water molecule is removed
from the starting material. An alcohol is heated under reflux in the
presence of an acid catalyst such as concentrated sulfuric acid, H,SO,
or concentrated phosphoric acid, H,PO . The product of the reaction is
an alkene.
Dehydration of an alcohol is an example of an elimination reaction.
The equation for the dehydration of the alcohol cyclohexanol is shown
in Figure 7. The products of the reaction are cyclohexene and water.

carbon dioxide and water. The equation shows the complete
combustion of ethanol.

The reaction is exothermic, releasing a large quantity of energy in the
form of heat. As the number of carbon atoms in the alcohol chain
increases the quantity of heat released per mole also increases.
Oxidation of alcohols
Primary and secondary alcohols can be oxidised by an oxidising agent.
The usual oxidising mixture is a solution of potassium dichromate(VI),
K,Cr,O, acidified with dilute sulfuric acid, H,SO,. If the alcohol
is oxidised, the orange solution containing dichromate(VI) ions is
reduced to a green solution containing chromium(III) ions (Figure 1).

Oxidation of primary alcohols
Primary alcohols can be oxidised to either aldehydes or carboxylic acids.
The product of the oxidation depends on the reaction conditions used
because aldehydes are themselves also oxidised to carboxylic acids.
Study tip
Preparation of aldehydes
On gentle heating of primary alcohols with acidified potassium
dichromate, an aldehyde is formed. To ensure that the aldehyde is
prepared rather than the carboxylic acid, the aldehyde is distilled out
of the reaction mixture as it forms. This prevents any further reaction
with the oxidising agent. The dichromate (VI) ions change colour
from orange to green, as shown in Figure 1.
Use [O] in brackets to show that
an oxidising agent is being used.
It makes balancing the equations
much easier, too!
The equation in Figure 2 shows the oxidation of butan-1-ol, a primary
alcohol, to form the aldehyde butanal, using acidified potassium
dichromate(VI). Notice that [O] is used to indicate the oxidising agent.

Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
→ polarity, solubility, and

The alcohol homologous series
Alcohols contain the -OH functional group, known as the hydroxyl
group. The hydroxyl group is responsible for both the physical and
chemical properties of the alcohols.
The simplest alcohol, methanol, CH,OH, is used as a high-performance
fuel because of its efficient combustion. Methanol is also an important
chemical feedstock - the starting material in many industrial
syntheses. It can be converted into polymers, paints, solvents,
insulation, adhesives, and many other useful products.
The second member of the alcohol homologous series, ethanol, is
used primarily in alcoholic drinks and as a fuel, and also finds use
as a solvent and a feedstock.
Naming alcohols
You will recall that the suffix -ol is added to the stem name of the
longest carbon chain. The position of the alcohol functional group
in the chain is indicated using a number.

drinks

Step 1: There are four carbons in the longest chain, so the stem
is butane.
Step 2: There are two-OH functional groups, so the suffix
is -diol.
Step 3: The-OH groups are on carbons 2 and 3, so the infix
is -2,3-.
Synoptic link
Step 4: The suffix-diol does not start with a vowel. The alkane
chain name is not shortened.
Step 5: There is a methyl group (-CH) on carbon 2. The prefix
2-methyl is added to the name.
Alcohols are named using the
rules introduced in Topic 11.2,
Nomenclature of organic
compounds.
Step 6: The compound is 2-methylbutane-2,3-diol.

14.1 Properties of alcohols
As the hydrocarbon chain increases in size, the influence of the -OH
group becomes relatively smaller, and the solubility of longer-chain
alcohols becomes more like that of hydrocarbons – solubility decreases.

Scraping ice from the windscreen of a car is one of the least pleasant tasks of
the early morning motorist. Spraying a solution of ethane-1,2-diol, also known
as ethylene glycol (Figure 6), onto the cold windscreen can melt away the ice in
seconds. Water freezes at 0 °C and ethane-1,2-diol at -13 °C, but when the two
are mixed the freezing point of the mixture can be as low as -40 °C.

See Topic 13.4, Electrophilic
addition in alkenes, for the
classification of carbocations as
primary, secondary, or tertiary.
Classifying alcohols
Alcohols can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. This
classification depends on the number of hydrogen atoms and
alkyl groups attached to the carbon atom that contains the alcohol
functional group.
Primary alcohols
Methanol and ethanol, the two simplest alcohols in the alcohols
homologous series, are both primary alcohols.
In a primary alcohol the -OH group is attached to a carbon atom that
is attached to two hydrogen atoms and one alkyl group. (Methanol,
with three hydrogen atoms and no carbon atoms attached, is an
exception that is still classified as a primary alcohol.)

Physical properties
When you compare the physical properties of alcohols with alkanes
of the same number of carbon atoms (e.g., methanol and methane),
there are some interesting differences. Alcohols are less volatile,
have higher melting points, and greater water solubility than the
corresponding alkanes. The differences become much smaller as the
length of the carbon chain increases.
If you are not sure about
electronegativity, polarity,
and intermolecular forces you
should look back at Topics 6.3,
Intermolecular forces, and 12.1,
The properties of alkanes.
These differences can be explained by considering the polarity of the
bonds in both the alkanes and alcohols, and the effect that these bonds
have on the strength of the intermolecular forces.
2501
alcohols
The alkanes have non-polar bonds because the
electronegativity of hydrogen and carbon are very similar.
The alkane molecules are therefore non-polar.
The intermolecular forces between non-polar molecules are
very weak London forces.
Alcohols have a polar 0-H bond because of the difference in
electronegativity of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms.
Alcohol molecules are therefore polar.
The intermolecular forces will be very weak London forces but
there will also be much stronger hydrogen bonds between the
polar 0-H groups.

Study tip
Volatility and boiling points
The difference in the boiling points of the alkanes and alcohols can
be seen in Figure 3. In the liquid state, intermolecular hydrogen
bonds hold the alcohol molecules together. These bonds must be
broken in order to change the liquid alcohol into a gas. This requires
more energy than overcoming the weaker London forces in alkanes,
so alcohols have a lower volatility than the alkanes with the same
number of carbon atoms.
Compounds with low boiling points
are volatile – they are easily
converted from a liquid to a gas.
The higher the boiling point, the
lower the volatility.
Solubility in water
A compound that can form hydrogen bonds with water is far more
water-soluble than a compound that cannot. Alkanes are non-polar
molecules and cannot form hydrogen bonds with water. Alcohols such
as methanol and ethanol are completely soluble in water, as hydrogen
bonds form between the polar -OH group of the alcohol and the water
molecules (Figure 4).
