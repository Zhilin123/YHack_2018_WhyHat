Continuous monitoring of rate
Concentration-time graphs can be plotted from continuous
measurements taken during the course of a reaction. This is called
continuous monitoring. You have already seen two methods for

Not all reactions produce gases, so another property is needed that can
be measured with time. A useful property is a colour change, which
can be estimated by eye or monitored using a colorimeter.

Monitoring rate with a colorimeter
In a colorimeter, the wavelength of the light passing through a
coloured solution is controlled using a filter. The amount of light
absorbed by a solution is measured (Figure 1).

18.3 Rate-concentration graphs and initial rates
The initial rates method
The initial rate is the instantaneous rate at the start of a reaction when
the time t = 0. The initial rate can be found by measuring the gradient
of a tangent drawn at t= 0 on a concentration-time graph.
Synoptic link
Look back to Topic 10.1, Reaction
rates, to revise measuring and
calculating the initial rate of
reaction using concentration-time
graphs.
A clock reaction is a more convenient way of obtaining the initial
rate of a reaction by taking a single measurement. The time from the
start of an experiment is measured for a visual change to be observed,
often a colour or a precipitate.
Provided that there is no significant change in rate during this time, it
can be assumed that the average rate of reaction over this time will be
the same as the initial rate.
The initial rate is then proportional to
The clock reaction is repeated several times with different concentrations,
and values of are calculated for each experimental run.
lodine clocks
A common type of clock reaction relies on the formation of iodine. As
aqueous iodine is coloured orange-brown, the time from the start of
the reaction and the appearance of the iodine colour can be measured.
Starch is usually added since it forms a complex with iodine which is a
an intense dark blue-black colour.
MTWTF

lodine clock procedure
Separate experiments are carried out using different concentrations of one of
the reactants and all other concentrations are kept constant. The colour change
is delayed by including a small amount of another chemical (e.g., aqueous
sodium thiosulfate, Na,, (aq)) which actually removes of iodine as it forms.
As soon as this chemical is all used up, the blue-black colour appears.
•
In each experiment, the solution is colourless at the start and the timet
is measured for the blue-black colour of the starch-iodine to appear.
The initial rate is proportional to
• A graph of (which is proportional to rate) against concentration is then
plotted and the shape matched to the shapes in Figure 1.
Further series of experiments are then carried out in which the
concentration of one of the other reactants is changed.
From the results, the order with respect to each reactant is determined and
a rate equation is written. The rate constant can then be calculated.

2 Select a filter with the complementary colour of the coloured chemical.
For iodine, this would be a green/blue filter but the colorimeter will
usually tell you which setting to use.
Zero the colorimeter with water.
Measure the absorbance readings of the standard solutions of iodine.
5 Plot a calibration curve (Figure 3) of absorbance against iodine
concentration. You now have a way of converting an absorbance reading
into a concentration of iodine.
6 Carry out the reaction between propanone and iodine. Take absorbance
readings of the reacting mixture at measured time intervals.
7 Use the calibration curve to measure the concentration of iodine at each
absorbance reading.
Finally plot a second graph of concentration of iodine against time. From
the concentration-time graph, you can determine the order of reaction
with respect to the coloured chemical in this case iodine).

You first encountered
concentration-time graphs in
Topic 10.1, Reaction rates.
Concentration-time graphs
Orders from shapes
The gradient of a concentration-time graph is the rate of the reaction.
The order with respect to a reactant can also be deduced from the
shape of a concentration-time graph for zero and first order reactions.
The order with respect to a reactant can only be obtained if all other
reactant concentrations remain effectively constant. Figure 4 shows the
variation of concentration with time for a zero order reaction and a first
order reaction.
zero order
concentration
Zero order
A zero order reaction produces a straight line with a negative gradient.
The reaction rate does not change at all during the course of the
reaction. The value of the gradient is equal to the rate constant k. The
straight-line graph makes a zero order relationship easy to identify.
first order
time
Figure 4 Concentration-time graphs
for zero and first order reactants
First order
A first order reaction produces a downward curve with a decreasing
gradient over time. As the gradient decreases with time, the reaction
gradually slows down. In a first order concentration-time graph,
the time for the concentration of the reactant to halve is constant.
This time is called the half-life and the rate constant of a first order
reaction can be determined using its value.
Study tip
Second order
The graph for a second order is also a downward curve, steeper at the
start, but tailing off more slowly.
You will not be expected to analyse
a concentration-time graph for a
second order reaction.

From the rate equation:
rate = k[A]
so, rate = k[A]
Rate is directly proportional to concentration for a first order
relationship.
The rate constant can be determined by measuring the gradient of
the straight line of this graph.
Second order
A second order reactant produces an upward curve with increasing
gradient.
From the rate equation:
rate = k[A]?
As this rate-concentration graph is a curve, the rate constant
cannot be obtained directly from this graph.
By plotting a second graph of the rate against the concentration
squared, the result is a straight line through the origin. The
gradient of this straight line graph is equal to the rate constant k.

Orders from experimental results
Orders of reaction must be determined experimentally by monitoring
how a physical quantity changes over time. Orders cannot be found
directly from the chemical equation. The example below shows
how the rate equation and rate constant can be determined from
experimental results. You will find out how these experimental results
could be obtained in Topic 18.3.
When comparing the effect of different concentrations of reactants on
reaction rates, it is important that the rate is always measured after the
same time, ideally as close to the start of the experiment as possible.
The example below shows the initial rate.
The initial rate is the instantaneous rate at the beginning of an
experiment when t = 0.

For consistency, chemists measure rates of reaction as the change of
concentration with a change in time:

Concentration is measured in mol dm-' and time can be any
convenient measurement, depending on the overall rate of the
reaction. If time has been measured in seconds, rate has the units of
mol dm-3
-, which should be written moldm-'s-1.
Synoptic link
In Topic 10.1, Reaction rates,
you learnt about some different
methods for monitoring the rate
of a reaction and how the rate
can be determined graphically. In
this chapter you will find out how
reaction rates are linked to the
concentration of reactants.
Because concentration is such a common term, chemists use a square
bracket as shorthand for concentration. For a reactant A:
[A] is shorthand for 'concentration of A'
[A] has the usual units of concentration, mol dm-.
Order of reaction
Changing the concentration often changes the rate of a reaction. The
rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of a particular
reactant raised to a power. For example, for reactant [A] and power n,
the rate is given by:
Study tip
The symbolec means proportional to.
rate « [A]"
For each reactant, the power is the order of reaction for that
reactant. In a reaction, different reactants can have different orders
and each may affect the rate in different ways. Common orders are
zero order (0), first order (1), and second order (2).

18.3 Rate-concentration graphs and initial rates
Clock reactions - how accurate?
In a clock reaction you are measuring the average rate during the first
part of the reaction. Over this time, you can assume that the average
rate of reaction is constant and is the same as the initial rate. In a clock
reaction, you are measuring an average rate of a change in reactant
over time. The shorter the period of time over which an average rate is
measured, the less the rate changes over that time period.
Figure 7 shows two concentration-time graphs, with the measured
rate shown by the dashed lines. On the left, the measurement of t is
from the first steepest part of the curve. The rate hardly changes and is
virtually the same as the initial rate. On the right, you can see that the
rate changes over the time measured and there is a difference from the
initial rate.

The initial rate measured during a clock reaction is an approximation
but it is still reasonably accurate provided that less than 15% of the
reaction has taken place. You can see from the graph on the right that
over 50% of the reactant has been used up.

Stage 1: Summarise the information that you know
The rate equation shows that the slow rate-determining step involves only one molecule of
(CH),CBr. OH- has no effect on the reaction rate and must be involved in a fast step.

• The other species formed must be (CH2)2C+.

Multi-step reactions
An overall chemical equation compares the reactants and products.
The balancing numbers give the stoichiometry, the relative amounts
of the species in the reaction. For example:

A reaction can only take place when particles collide. For the reaction
above to take place in a single step, one molecule of 1,0, two I ions,
and two H+ ions would have to collide together simultaneously, which
is an extremely unlikely event.
Such reactions are much more likely to take place in a series of steps
and it is unlikely that more than two particles will collide together at
the same time. The series of steps that make up an overall reaction is
called the reaction mechanism.
Synoptic link
See Topic 3.4, Reacting quantities,
for more details of stoichiometry
The rate-determining step
The steps in a multi-step reaction will take place at different rates. The
slowest step in the sequence is called the rate-determining step.
Study tip
Predicting reaction mechanisms
Chemists use their knowledge and understanding of chemical
principles to propose possible mechanisms for reactions. But how do
you know whether a reaction mechanism is likely to be correct?
Imagine a production line in a
factory. Three steps are involved
in making a product. The first step
takes 30 minutes to complete. The
other two steps take two minutes.
The first step is the slowest step
and takes up the vast majority
of the time required to make the
product. The first step is the rate-
determining step.
The rate equation only includes reacting species involved in the
rate-determining step.
The orders in the rate equation match the number of species
involved in the rate-determining step.
So the rate-determining step provides important evidence in
supporting or rejecting a proposed reaction mechanism.

In a zero order reaction:
• any number raised to the power zero is 1
concentration does not influence the rate.
Study tip
You can test this maths on your
calculator.
First order
A reaction is first order with respect to a reactant when the rate
depends on its concentration raised to the power of one:
Try raising any number to the
power zero and you will always get
1 as the answer
first order:
rate a [A]
In a first order reaction:
Study tip
•
if the concentration of A is doubled (x2), the reaction rate
increases by a factor of 21 = 2
if the concentration of A is tripled (X3), the reaction rate
increases by a factor of 31 = 3.
In a first order reaction, any change
in concentration gives the same
change to the rate.
Second order
A reaction is second order with respect to a reactant when the rate
depends on its concentration raised to the power of two:
second order: rate « [A]?
In a second order reaction:
if the concentration of A is doubled (X2), the reaction rate
increases by a factor of 22 = 4
if the concentration of A is tripled (X3), the reaction rate increases
by a factor of 32 = 9.
Study tip
In a second order reaction, any
change in concentration changes
the rate by the square of the change.
The rate equation and the rate constant
The rate equation gives the mathematical relationship between
the concentrations of the reactants and the reaction rate. For two
reactants, A and B, the rate equation is shown below.

The rate constant k is the proportionality constant. It is the number
that mathematically converts between the rate of reaction and
concentration and orders.
Overall order
The overall order of reaction gives the overall effect of the concentrations
of all reactants on the rate of reaction. It is calculated as follows:
Study tip
A proportionality constant is just
like an exchange rate.
Here the rate constant is the
'exchange rate' that converts
concentration into rate (and
vice versa).
overall order = sum of orders with respect to each reactant.
So, for the rate equation:
rate = K[A]”[B]"
overall order = m + 11

18.5 Rate constants and
temperature
Specification reference: 5.1.1
The effect of temperature on rate constants
You have already seen how temperature changes can affect the rate of
a reaction in terms of the Boltzmann distribution.
As temperature increases, the rate increases and the value of the rate
constant k will also increase. For many reactions each 10 °C rise in
temperature doubles the rate constant and doubles the rate of the
reaction. Figure 1 shows the typical variation of a rate constant with
temperature.

What factors affect the rate constant?
When temperature increases, two factors contribute to the increased
rate and rate constant.
Synoptic link
Increasing the temperature shifts the Boltzmann distribution to
the right, increasing the proportion of particles that exceed the
activation energy Eq.
As the temperature increases, particles move faster and collide
more frequently.
To react, particles must also collide with the correct orientation,
Look back at Topic 10.3, The
Boltzmann distribution, to
revise the basics of the effect of
temperature on reaction rates.
With increasing temperature, the increased frequency of collisions is
comparatively small compared with the increase in the proportion of
molecules that exceed E from the shift in the Boltzmann distribution.
So the change in rate is mainly determined by E.
rate constant k
The Arrhenius equation
You have seen that rate constants can be determined experimentally.
By carrying out the same experiment at different temperatures, rate
constants can be calculated at different temperatures. The graph in
Figure 1 shows the variation of the rate constant with temperature.
The Arrhenius equation, shown below, is an exponential relationship
between the rate constant k and temperature T.

18.5 Rate constants and temperature
The exponential factor e-Eg/RT represents the proportion of molecules that
exceed E and that have sufficient energy for a reaction to take place.
The pre-exponential term (frequency factor) A takes into account
the frequency of collisions with the correct orientation. This term
does increase slightly with temperature as the frequency of collisions
increases but it is essentially constant over a small temperature
range. The frequency factor essentially gives the rate if there were no
activation energy.
Logarithmic form of the Arrhenius equation
The Arrhenius equation can also be expressed as a logarithmic
relationship:
In k=-6m + In A
This form of the Arrhenius equation is very useful as it enables both
E and A to be determined graphically. A plot of In k against
gives a
straight line graph of the type y = mx + c (Figure 2).

So a plot of In k against gives a downward straight line with:

Depending on whether In k is positive or negative, you may find that
your graph comes either side of the origin (it may even straddle the
X-axis). However, the principle is the same. The gradient is - and
intercept is In A.
Study tip
As you have seen, there are two
forms of the Arrhenius equation.
You will mainly be using the
logarithmic form of the equation to
determine E and A graphically, but
it is important that you recognise
the exponential form of the
Arrhenius equation, k=A e E/RT.

18.2 Concentration-time graphs
Determination of k for a first order reaction
There are two methods for determining the rate constant from a
concentration-time graph for a first order reaction.
Synoptic link
Calculating the rate constant from the rate
A tangent to the curve on the concentration-time graph is drawn at
a particular concentration. The gradient of the tangent is calculated
giving the rate of reaction.
Refer back to Topic 10.1, Reaction
rates, to see how the gradient of a
tangent gives the rate of reaction.
The rate constant is calculated by rearranging the rate equation and
substituting the value of rate (the gradient of the tangent) and the
concentration at the position where the tangent has been drawn.
Study tip
rate
rate = k[N,O,(9)] so, k = in
K [N,0;(g)]
In Figure 4, a tangent has been drawn at [N,O(g)] = 0.050 mol dm-3.
Remember that you can find
the units of a rate constant by
substituting units into the rate
expression and cancelling the
common units.

RATES OF REACTIONS
Half-life and first order reactions
Half-life
Half-life 1, is the time taken for half of a reactant to be used up.
First order reactions have a constant half-life with the concentration
halving every half life. This pattern is called exponential decay.
A first order relationship can be confirmed from a concentration-time
graph by measuring successive half-lives. If they are the same, the
reaction is first order with respect to the reactant.
Study tip
Half life is the time taken for the
concentration of a reactant to
decrease to half its original value.
Dinitrogen pentoxide, decomposes to nitrogen dioxide and oxygen.
21,05(g) → 4NO2(g) + O2(g)
Figure 5 shows a concentration-time graph for this decomposition.
A tangent has been drawn when the concentration is 0.050 mol dm-3.
This enables the rate to be calculated at this concentration,
The graph shows three successive half-lives with a constant value
of 100 s.
The constant half-life means that this reaction is first order with
respect to N2O5
• [N,0.), is the initial concentration of N, O, at time = 0 s.
The rate equation for this reaction is then:
