Indirect determination of enthalpy changes
In Topic 9.1, you learnt about several standard enthalpy changes.
Chemists have determined the values of many of these enthalpy
changes and have listed them in data books. The most useful values
are for standard enthalpy changes of formation A.HⓇ and combustion
A Hº. The worked examples show how known enthalpy changes can
be used with Hess' law to determine enthalpy changes indirectly.
Remember, for elements A,
His
always zero (Topic 9.1).
Usually you will not be provided
with a value of zero for elements.
6) Worked example: Enthalpy changes from AH®
You can work out the standard enthalpy change of any reaction from the standard enthalpy changes of
formation A, HⓇ of the reactants and products.
Calculate the standard enthalpy change of reaction for the reaction shown below.
Fe,0,(s) + 3 Ca(s) — 2Fe(s) + 3CaO(s)
The standard enthalpy changes of formation of the reactants and products are listed in Table 1.

Step 1: Construct the enthalpy cycle between the reactants, the products, and their elements. In the
enthalpy cycle, the elements, Fe(s), Ca(s), and 0, (g), form the common link between reactants
and products. Using A.HⓇ, the reactants and products of the original reaction are formed from
their elements and the arrow points upwards.

The equation for the formation of butane, C.H.(g), is shown below.
4C(s) + 5H2(g) → C4H10()
It would be impossible to measure the enthalpy change of this reaction directly.
Carbon and hydrogen form so many compounds that C_H10 would be formed alongside
dozens of other compounds.
However, the enthalpy changes of combustion of the reactants C(s) and H, (g) and of the product
C,H, (g) can all be measured directly. The enthalpy change of reaction can then be found indirectly
using the A Hº values shown in Table 2.

9.1 Enthalpy changes
Synoptic link
You will learn more about
activation energy and its relevance
to catalysis in Chapter 10, Reaction
rates and equilibrium.
Activation energy
Atoms and ions are held together by chemical bonds. During chemical
reactions, the bonds in the reactants need to be broken by an input
of energy. New bonds in the products can then form to complete the
reaction. The energy input required to break bonds acts as an energy
barrier to the reaction, known as the activation energy E Activation
energy is the minimum energy required for a reaction to take place.
Figures 4 and 5 show full enthalpy profile diagrams for exothermic
and endothermic reactions. Note that these diagrams show the
reactants and products, together with labels for AH and E.

AH is
negative
In general, reactions with small activation energies take place very
rapidly, because the energy needed to break bonds is readily available
from the surroundings. Very large activation energies may be present
such a large energy barrier that a reaction may take place extremely
slowly or even not at all.

Standard enthalpy changes
The enthalpy change for a reaction can vary slightly depending on
the conditions used. Chemists use standard conditions for physical
measurements such as enthalpy changes, close to typical working
conditions of temperature and pressure. Tables of data always include
values taken under standard conditions.

A standard physical value, such as an enthalpy, is shown in data
tables using a special standard sign®. A standard enthalpy change AH
refers to an enthalpy H change A under standard conditions
Units are usually kJ mol-', with mol-' referring to the amount in
mol given by the balancing numbers of the chemicals in a stated
equation for the reaction (see enthalpy change of reaction below).

You will learn about the Kelvin
scale of temperature in Topic 9.2,
Measuring enthalpy changes.
• Standard pressure is 100 kPa. This is very close to a pressure
of one atmosphere, 101 kPa.
• Standard temperature is a stated temperature, usually 298 K
(25°C). In this book, standard temperature refers to 298 K.
Standard concentration is 1 mol dm' (this is relevant
for solutions only).
Standard state is the physical state of a substance under
standard conditions. Most data tables show the standard state
at 100 kPa and 298 K.
Enthalpy change of reaction
The standard enthalpy change of reaction 4 Hº is the enthalpy
change that accompanies a reaction in the molar quantities shown in
a chemical equation under standard conditions, with all reactants and
products in their standard states.

9.4 Hess' law and enthalpy cycles
Specification reference: 3.2.1
Hess' law
The techniques described in Topic 9.2 allow enthalpy changes to
be determined directly in a single experiment. Unfortunately, the
enthalpy changes of many reactions are very difficult to determine
directly. Hess' law comes to the rescue, allowing enthalpy changes
to be determined indirectly.

Hess' law states that, if a reaction can take place by two routes, and
the starting and finishing conditions are the same, the total enthalpy
change is the same for each route.
Hess' law comes from the idea of conservation of energy (see Topic 9.1)
and is easy to visualise with a diagram. Figure 1 shows an enthalpy
cycle with two routes for converting reactants into products.
→ unfamiliar enthalpy cycles.
Following the arrows from reactants to
products for the two routes:
Route 1: A+B
Route 2: C
By Hess' law, the total enthalpy change
is the same for each route.
A+B=C
If two of A, B, and C are known, the
third can be calculated.

Enthalpy and enthalpy change
Enthalpy
Enthalpy His a measure of the heat energy in a chemical system.
The chemical system refers to the atoms, molecules, or ions making
up the chemicals.
Enthalpy is sometimes thought of as the energy stored within bonds.
Enthalpy cannot be measured, but enthalpy changes can.
Enthalpy change
In a chemical reaction, the reactants and products are likely to
have different enthalpies. The difference in the enthalpies is the
enthalpy change AH:
AH = H (products) - H(reactants)
AH can be positive or negative, depending on whether the products
contain more or less energy than the reactants.
Conservation of energy
The law of conservation of energy is one of the fundamental rules
of science and states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
universe = system + surroundings
When a chemical reaction involving an enthalpy change takes place,
heat energy is transferred between the system and the surroundings.
-surroundings
System
(contents of flask)
The system is the chemicals - the reactants and products.
The surroundings are the apparatus (e.g., the thermometer
and apparatus), the laboratory, and everything that is not the
chemical system.
The universe is everything, and includes both system and
surroundings, as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1 The system and
the surroundings
Heat in or heat out?
Unlike enthalpy, an enthalpy change AH can be determined
experimentally by measuring the energy transfer between the system
and the surroundings.
Energy transfer can be in either of two directions:
. from the system to the surroundings - an exothermic change
• from the surroundings to the system - an endothermic change.
In Figures 2 and 3, the diagrams on the left are called enthalpy
profile diagrams. Each diagram shows the relative enthalpies of
the reactants and products and the enthalpy change AH.
124
ENTHALPY
Despite this limitation, the calculated enthalpy change of reaction
should be in general agreement with the actual enthalpy change
of reaction.
Calculations using average bond enthalpies need all species to be
gaseous molecules. In the worked example above, you produced
H2O(g) rather than H,O(l). This means that your calculated AH
is not a standard enthalpy change. You could still work out the
standard enthalpy change but you would need to also take into
account the enthalpy change for H2O(g) condensing into H2O(l).
Bond enthalpies and combustion
Values for the enthalpy change of combustion of alcohols can be calculated
from bond enthalpies. A H values for three alcohols are shown below
together with their equations.
CH,OH + 1.502 - CO2 + 2H,0 4H=-658 kJ mol-1
C,H,OH + 30, 200, + 3H,0 A H=-1276 kJ mol-1
C,H,OH + 4.50, – 300, + 4H20 AH=-1894 kJ mol-1
The enthalpy changes increase by a constant quantity for each increase in the
carbon chain length. The reason is all linked to bond breaking and bond making.
Study tip
In a question, if you are only
provided with an equation,
always draw out all the bonds.
It is then much easier to get the
number of each type of bond
correct. The calculations are not
difficult, but many students slip
up by short-cutting and getting
the wrong number of bonds.

broken and made during combustion in progressing from one alcohol?
2 What would be the calculated enthalpy change of combustion of the
alcohol with 20 carbon atoms?

Average bond enthalpy
In this topic you will look at how average bond enthalpies can be used
to calculate enthalpy changes of reaction without carrying out any
experiments, as well as the limitations of this approach.
Learning outcomes

calculating enthalpy changes
from bond enthalpies.
Average bond enthalpy is the energy required to break one mole of
a specified type of bond in a gaseous molecule.
•
Energy is always required to break bonds.
Bond enthalpies are always endothermic.
Bond enthalpies always have a positive enthalpy value.
Synoptic link
Table 1 lists average bond enthalpies for some of the more common
covalent bonds. You will need to refer to this table during this topic.
Limitations of average bond enthalpies
The actual bond enthalpy can vary depending on the chemical
environment of the bond. Figure 1 shows examples of the actual
bond enthalpy of a C-H bond in different environments.
In Topic 5.3, Covalent bonding, you
learnt that average bond enthalpy
is a measurement of covalent bond
strength - the larger the value of
the average bond enthalpy, the
stronger the covalent bond.

9.2 Measuring enthalpy changes
Specification reference: 3.2.1, 2.1.3
Measuring energy changes
In Topic 9.1, you looked at the distinction between the chemical
system and the surroundings. When you carry out experiments
to determine enthalpy changes, the thermometer is part of the
surroundings and you will be measuring the temperature change of
the surroundings.
Learning outcomes

The Kelvin scale of temperature
The Kelvin scale of temperature is commonly used in science. It starts
at absolute zero, OK and is equivalent to -273°C. The Kelvin scale
is part of the International System of Units (SI units). On the Kelvin
scale, ice melts at 273 K (0°C) and water boils at 373K (100°C). So a
1K rise in temperature is the same as a 1°C rise in temperature. If you
record temperatures using a thermometer graduated in °C, the value
of the temperature change is exactly the same in °C and K.

The specific heat capacity of the surroundings c
Different materials require different quantities of energy to produce the
same temperature change. The specific heat capacity c is the energy
required to raise the temperature of lg of a substance by 1K.
Every substance has a specific heat capacity. Good conductors of
heat, such as metals, have small values of c. Insulators of heat such as
foam plastic, have large values of c. In most experiments, you will be
measuring the temperature change of water or aqueous solutions. For
water, c = 4.18Jg-K-!.

The temperature change AT is determined from the thermometer

Calculating an energy change
Heat energy is given the symbol q. Once you have values for m, c,
and AT from an experiment, it is very easy to calculate the energy in
joules (J) using the simple equation below.
Study tip
It is easy to convert between Kelvin
and Celsius. Add 273 to a Celsius
reading to get the Kelvin reading.
Subtract 273 from a Kelvin reading

Step 3: Calculate A H in kJ mol-!
A H is the enthalpy change for the complete combustion of
1 mol CH,OH.
In the experiment, 0.0500 mol CH,OH transfers 25.707 kJ of
energy to the water.
The water gained 25.707 kJ of energy from the combustion
of 0.050 mol CH, OH
1 mol CH,OH has lost 27.407 = 514.14 kJ of energy on
0.0500
combustion A H(CH,OH) = -514 kJ mol-I.
AH only makes an appearance
right at the end. This is the
time to decide on the sign. As
water has gained energy, the
combustion of methanol must
have lost the same quantity of
energy. So AH is negative and the
reaction is exothermic.

In the calculation, rounding was left until the final answer. This will always
give the most accurate result. Work out the error that is introduced in the
final answer by rounding the answer in Step 1 to:
a three significant figures
b two significant figures.
As part of the practical skills required
for your course, you need to know
how to measure mass, volumes of
solutions, and volumes of gases.
This practical application box tells you
how to measure masses.
Measuring masses, volumes of
solutions, and volumes or gases are
also covered in:
Topic 3.2, Determination of
formulae, for how to measure mass
Topic 3.4, Reacting quantities, for how
to measure the volumes of gases
Topic 4.2, Acid-base titrations, for
how to measure volumes of solutions
Topic 10.1, Reaction rates, for how
to measure volumes of gases.
How accurate is the experimental AH value?
The data book value for A H of methanol is - 726 kJ mol-!. This seems
very different from the experimental value of -514kJ mol-1 shown
above. Data book values are obtained using much more sophisticated
apparatus than a spirit burner and a beaker of water. Clearly much less
heat was transferred to the water in our experiment than expected.
Possible reasons are listed below.
Heat loss to the surroundings other than the water.
This includes the beaker but mainly the air surrounding
the flame.
Incomplete combustion of methanol.
There may be some incomplete combustion, with carbon
monoxide and carbon being produced instead of carbon dioxide.
You would see carbon as a black layer of soot on the beaker.
Evaporation of methanol from the wick.
The burner must be weighed as soon as possible after
extinguishing the flame. Otherwise some methanol may have
evaporated from the wick. Spirit burners usually have a cover
to reduce this error.
Non-standard conditions.
The data book value is a standard value. The conditions for this
experiment are unlikely to be identical to standard conditions.
Study tip
Be very careful when comparing
negative numbers.
The experimental and data book
values for A Hare -514 kJ mol-1
and - 726 kJ mol-1. Correct
comparisons for the experimental
value would be less exothermic
or less negative. Do not be
tempted to state simply that the
experimental value is less.
-514 is more than - 726 as -514
is less negative!
All but the last of these reasons would lead to a value for A H that is
less exothermic than expected.

Use of draught screens and an input of oxygen gas could minimise

Determination of an enthalpy change
of reaction AH
Many reactions take place between two solutions, or between a
solid and a solution. The enthalpy change of these reactions can be
determined using plastic cups made of polystyrene foam. These are
cheap, waterproof and light weight, and offer some insulation against
heat loss to the surroundings.
When carrying out reactions between aqueous solutions, the solution
itself is the immediate surroundings. The chemical particles within
the solutions may react when they collide, and any energy transfer is
between the chemical particles and water molecules in the solution.
A thermometer in the solution will record any temperature change,
allowing the heat energy change to be calculated using mcAT.
