HALOALKANES
The end of the road for organohalogen compounds?
In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was signed, which
introduced steps for the complete removal of CFCs in
all but a limited number of products where no suitable
alternative can be found. Research into alternatives
for refrigeration and air conditioning units have led to
the development of coolants that use hydrocarbons,
ammonia, or even carbon dioxide. For sprays, some
companies have produced pump-action spray dispensers
to replace products in aerosol form. Where aerosols
are still being used, the propellant is most likely to be a
hydrocarbon such as butane.

Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are organobromine
compounds commonly used by the electronics industry
in components such as circuit boards, outer coverings,
and cables to reduce the flammability of the product.
Organobromine compounds are currently under close
scrutiny as scientists suspect that they are toxins that
may interfere with the effective function of the human
endocrine system.

Naming the haloalkanes
Haloalkanes are compounds containing the elements carbon, hydrogen,
and at least one halogen. When naming haloalkanes, a prefix is added
to the name of the longest chain to indicate the identity of the halogen
(Table 1). When two or more halogens are present in a structure they
are listed in alphabetical order.
In this chapter you will mainly learn about aliphatic haloalkanes,
in which the halogen is joined to a straight or branched carbon
chain. These compounds, like alcohols, can be classified as primary,
secondary, and tertiary.

Reactivity of the haloalkanes
Haloalkanes have a carbon-halogen bond in their structure. Halogen
atoms are more electronegative than carbon atoms. The electron pair
in the carbon-halogen bond is therefore closer to the halogen atom
than the carbon atom. The carbon-halogen bond is polar (Figure 2).
HH
A Figure 2 Polarity in a carbon-chlorine
bond. The bonding pair of electrons is
closer to the chlorine atom than the
carbon atom
In haloalkanes the carbon atom has a slightly positive charge and can
attract species containing a lone pair of electrons. Species that donate
a lone pair of electrons are known as nucleophiles. A nucleophile
is an atom or group of atoms that is attracted to an electron deficient
carbon atom, where it donates a pair of electrons to form a new
covalent bond.
Nucleophiles include:

15.1 The chemistry of the haloalkanes
Hydrolysis and carbon-halogen bond strength
In hydrolysis, the carbon-halogen bond is broken and the -OH
group replaces the halogen in the haloalkane. The rate of hydrolysis
depends upon the strength of the carbon-halogen bond in the
haloalkane. The bond enthalpies for the carbon-halogen bonds
are shown in Figure 4.

Bond type
A Figure 4 Graph showing the bond enthalpies for the carbon-halogen bond
You can see from the graph that the C-F bond is the strongest
carbon-halogen bond and the C-I bond the weakest. Less energy is
required to break the C-I bond than other carbon-halogen bonds.
From these bond enthalpies we can predict that:
iodoalkanes react faster than bromoalkanes
bromoalkanes react faster than chloroalkanes
fluoroalkanes are unreactive as a large quantity of energy is
required to break the C-F bond.
You can test out some of these predictions by carrying out an
experiment to hydrolyse some haloalkanes.
Measuring the rate of hydrolysis of primary haloalkanes
In this experiment you compare the rate of hydrolysis of three
haloalkanes: 1-chlorobutane, 1-bromobutane, and 1-iodobutane.
The general equation for hydrolysis of these haloalkanes with water is
shown in the equation below. X represents any of the halogens.

The rate of each reaction can be followed by carrying out the reaction
in the presence of aqueous silver nitrate. As the reaction takes place
halide ions, X-(aq), are produced which react with Ag+ (aq) ions to
form a precipitate of the silver halide.

HALOALKANES
When a haloalkane reacts with a nucleophile, the nucleophile replaces
the halogen in a substitution reaction. A new compound is produced
containing a different functional group. The reaction mechanism is
nucleophilic substitution.
Nucleophilic substitution in the haloalkanes
Primary haloalkanes undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with
a variety of different nucleophiles to produce a wide range of different
compounds. Substitution is a reaction in which one atom or group of
atoms is replaced by another atom or group of atoms.
Hydrolysis
Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction involving water or an aqueous
solution of a hydroxide that causes the breaking of a bond in a
molecule. This results in the molecule being split into two products.
In the hydrolysis of a haloalkane, the halogen atom is replaced by
an -OH group. This is an example of a nucleophilic substitution
reaction which takes place as follows:
1 The nucleophile, OH , approaches the carbon atom attached to
the halogen on the opposite side of the molecule from the halogen
atom (Figure 3).
2 This direction of attack by the OH-ion minimises repulsion
between the nucleophile and the 5, halogen atom.
3 A lone pair of electrons on the hydroxide ion is attracted and
donated to the 8+ carbon atom.
4 A new bond is formed between the oxygen atom of the hydroxide
ion and the carbon atom.
5 The carbon-halogen bond breaks by heterolytic fission.
6 The new organic product is an alcohol. A halide ion is also formed.
The mechanism for the reaction is shown in Figure 3.

Haloalkanes can be converted to alcohols using aqueous sodium
hydroxide. The reaction is very slow at room temperature so the

Uses of organohalogen compounds
Organohalogen compounds are molecules that contain at least one
halogen atom joined to a carbon chain. They have found many
practical uses, some of which are listed in Table 1.
Organohalogen compounds are also used in many pesticides.

The ozone layer
The ozone layer is found at the outer edge of the stratosphere, at a
height that varies from about 10 to 40 km above the Earth's surface.
Only a tiny fraction of the gases making up the ozone layer is ozone, but
this is enough to absorb most of the biologically damaging ultraviolet
radiation (called UV-B) from the Sun's rays, allowing only a small
amount to reach the Earth's surface. UV-B radiation is the radiation
most commonly linked to sunburn and much research has been carried
out on its harmful effects. It is feared that continued depletion of the
ozone layer will allow more UV-B radiation to reach the Earth's surface.
This is very bad news for living organisms, leading to increased genetic
damage and a greater risk of skin cancer in humans.

A steady state is then set up involving 0, and the oxygen radicals
in which ozone forms and then breaks down. In this steady state,
the rate of formation of ozone is the same as the rate at which it is
broken down:
0, +0=0
Study tip
Human activity, especially in the production and use of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), has upset this delicate equilibrium.
Though O is not drawn with the
typical'radical dot', it is still a radical.
CFCs and the ozone layer
Until recently, CFCs and HCFCs were the most common compounds
used as refrigerants, in air-conditioning units, and as aerosol
propellants. CFCs are very stable because of the strength of the
carbon-halogen bonds within their molecules. In 1973 two chemists,
Frank Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina, began to look at the
235
15.2 Organohalogen compounds in the environment

impact of CFCs on the Earth's atmosphere. They concluded that
CFCs remain stable until they reach the stratosphere (Figure 1). Here
the CFCs begin to break down, forming chlorine radicals, which
are thought to catalyse the breakdown of the ozone layer. In 1995,
Sherwood and Molina were awarded a Nobel Prize for their work in
discovering this ozone depletion.

How do CFCs deplete the ozone layer?
The stability of CFCs, due to the strength of their carbon-halogen
bonds, means that CFCs have a long residence time in the
troposphere. It may take them many years to reach the stratosphere.
Once in the stratosphere UV radiation provides sufficient energy to
break a carbon-halogen bond in CFCs by homolytic fission to form
radicals. The C-Cl bond has the lowest bond enthalpy and so is the
bond that breaks.

A Figure 1 Earth's atmosphere is
divided into five layers. We exist in
the lowest level, the troposphere. The
stratosphere is the next layer up, and
includes the ozone layer
As radiation initiates the breakdown, this process is called
photodissociation. The photodissociation of CF,C1, is shown below.
CF,Cl2 → CF Cl• + Cl.
The chlorine radical formed, Cl, is a very reactive intermediate. It can
react with an ozone molecule, breaking down the ozone into oxygen.
This breakdown occurs by a two-step process:
propagation step 1 Cl. + 0; ClO. + 0
propagation step 2 CO. + 0 + Cl + 0,
The overall equation is 03 + 0
202
Propagation step 2 regenerates a chlorine radical, which can attack
and remove another molecule of ozone in propagation step 1. The
two propagation steps repeat in a cycle over and over again in a
chain reaction. It has been estimated that a single CFC molecule can
promote the breakdown of 100 000 molecules of ozone.
Synoptic link
This photodissociation is the
initiation step in a chain reaction.
See Topic 12.2, Chemical reactions
of alkanes, to review the reaction
mechanism of radical substitution,
which is similar.
Are CFCs responsible for all ozone-depleting reactions?
The simple answer is no. Other radicals also catalyse the breakdown of
ozone. Nitrogen oxide radicals are formed naturally during lightning
strikes, and also as a result of aircraft travel in the stratosphere.
Nitrogen oxide radicals cause the breakdown of ozone by a mechanism
similar to that involving chlorine radicals.
propagation step 1 NO. + 0 NO. + 02
propagation step 2 NO. + 0 NO. + 0,
The overall equation is the same as with chlorine radicals, showing
that the radicals act as a catalyst for the process.

Clearly the strength of the carbon-halogen bond is not
the only factor that influences the rate of hydrolysis.
If you examine the structures of the three haloalkanes,
you will notice that one haloalkane is primary, one is
secondary and one is tertiary (Figure 7).
The data shows that the tertiary haloalkane is hydrolysed
fastest, whilst hydrolysis of the primary haloalkane
is the slowest. The main reason lies with the reaction
mechanism. A primary haloalkane will react by a
one-step mechanism (look back at Figure 3), whereas a
tertiary haloalkane reacts by a two-step mechanism.

In the first step, the carbon-halogen bond of the

These observations are explained by considering the bond enthalpies

1-Iodobutane reacts fastest and the C-I bond is the weakest.
