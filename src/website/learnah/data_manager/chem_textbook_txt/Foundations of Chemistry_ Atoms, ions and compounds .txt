ATOMS, IONS, AND COMPOUNDS
Writing equations
Study tip
You will have practised balancing equations at GCSE. For A Level
chemistry, you will come across many more equations, but you will
find that balancing them quickly becomes second nature. By the
end of the course you should be able to write equations for all the
reactions you have studied and also for some unfamiliar reactions.
Remember to use brackets.
Students often lose marks by
omitting brackets when writing the
formula of a hydroxide.
Magnesium hydroxide contains
Mg2+ and OH ions.
Mgot, is incorrect as it means one
oxygen and two hydrogen atoms!
The correct formula is Mg(OH)2
Representing elements and compounds in equations
Elements
In equations, elements are shown simply as their symbol except
for the few elements that exist as small molecules. Most of these
elements exist as diatomic molecules, containing two atoms
bonded together - Hy, N, Oy, Fy, Cly, Bry, and I,. The only other
elements that exist as small molecules are phosphorus, P, and
sulfur, S. (However, it is normal practice to write sulfur simply as
S in equations - otherwise every formula in the equation has to be
multiplied up by a factor of 8.)
Brackets are added if there is more
than one polyatomic ion in a formula.
Compounds
Covalent compounds do not contain ions. Most covalent compounds
exist as molecules with a small number of atoms bonded together,
for example, Co, and H,O. In equations, the formula of the molecule
is used.
Synoptic link
You will find out more about these
different formulae in Topic 3.2,
Determination of formulae.
For ionic compounds, the formula worked out from the ionic charges
is used in equations. This is called the formula unit.
State symbols in chemical equations
State symbols are shown in brackets after a formula to indicate the
physical state. There are four state symbols:
.
.
(g) - gas
(1) - liquid
(s) - solid
(aq) - dissolved in water (aqueous)

Balancing equations
To balance an equation, you multiply each formula by a balancing
number until the number of atoms of each element is the same on
each side of the equation. Balancing numbers are written in front of
each formula.
2 Na O means two Na O formula units giving 2 x 2 = 4 Nat and
2 x 1 = 2 02-ions.
When balancing equations, it is
a common mistake to change a
formula
The formula for water is H,0. DO NOT
change the formula to H,02, this is
hydrogen peroxide!
• When balancing an equation you must not change any chemical
formula.
Balancing numbers go in front of chemical formulae and on the line
(not subscripted).
The equation is balanced when there are the same number of
atoms of each element on each side of the equation.

hydrogen. The isotope is often referred to as deuterium and even given
its own symbol, D. The formula for heavy water is often written simply as 1,0.
The chemical properties of heavy water are almost identical to those of normal
water. However, it has slightly different physical properties, shown in Table 3.

The greater density of D, gives heavy water its name. If all water were

a higher temperature.

Atomic structure of ions
An ion is a charged atom. The number of electrons is different from the
number of protons.
• Positive ions, or cations, are atoms with fewer electrons than
protons. Cations have an overall positive charge.
Negative ions, or anions, are atoms with more electrons than
protons. Anions have an overall negative charge.

2.2 Relative mass

mass to compare the masses of atoms. Later you will see that this idea
is extended to all chemicals.

Carbon-12
Table 1 shows the relative mass of protons, neutrons, and electrons.
V Table 1 Masses of three subatomic
particles
To find the relative mass of an isotope, it might seem sensible to add
together the relative masses of the protons, neutrons, and electrons -
but things are not that simple. In fact, the strong nuclear force holding
together protons and neutrons comes at the expense of the loss of a
fraction of their mass. This astonishing fact was worked out by Albert
Einstein over 100 years ago. The small amount of mass lost is called
the mass defect. If you are studying A Level physics, you may learn
more about the mass defect and its importance to the nucleus.

So how do chemists calculate the mass of atoms if some mass is lost to
hold the nucleus together?
First, a standard isotope is needed on which to base all atomic masses.
This role is taken by the carbon-12 isotope, which is the international
standard for the measurement of atomic masses. One atom of carbon-12
has a mass of 1.992646 538 x 10-26 kg. Working in kg would be very
awkward so instead a new unit called the atomic mass unit u is used.
•
Figure 1 Carbon-12 contains six
protons (black), six neutrons (blue), and
six electrons (red). An atom of carbon-12
has a mass of exactly 12 u
The mass of a carbon-12 isotope is defined as exactly 12 atomic
mass units (12 u).
The standard mass for atomic mass is lu, the mass of th of an
atom of carbon-12.
On this scale, lu is approximately the mass of a proton or
a neutron.
Study tip
Relative isotopic mass
Relative isotopic mass is the mass of an isotope relative to th of the
mass of an atom of carbon-12. Table 2 shows the relative isotopic mass
of several isotopes relative to the mass of carbon-12. Relative isotopic
mass has no units because it is a ratio of two masses.
You need to learn the definition for
relative isotopic mass.

2.3 Formulae and equations
Study tip
Aluminium oxide is an ionic
compound, so you will need to
use ionic charges.
Study tip
Aluminium is shown simply as its
symbol, AI.
Oxygen exists as diatomic
molecules and so is shown as 0.
3) Worked example: Constructing a balanced equation
Aluminium reacts with oxygen to form aluminium oxide.
Step 1: Work out the formulae.
Aluminium oxide contains AB+ and 02- ions, so the formula
is Al,03
Step 2: Write an equation using formulae for all reactants
and products.
Formulae only: Al + 02 - A1,03
Step 3: Balance the equation by placing balancing numbers on
the line, in front of formulae.
The key here is to get the oxygen atoms equal on both sides.
4Al + 30, +2A1,03
As a final check,
• Left-hand side has 4 Al and 3 x 2 (6) O
• Right-hand side has 2 x A1,0, = 2 x 2 (= 4) Al and 2 x 3 (= 6) O
The equation is balanced.
Step 4: Finally, add state symbols to complete the equation.
4Al(s) + 302(g) → 2A1,03(s)
Study tip
Start with the formulae of
compounds and count the number
of atoms of each element.
Study tip
You are allowed to use fractions
when balancing equations. If you are
comfortable using fractions, this can
be easier than whole numbers. For
the worked example, this would give
2A1 + 130, A1,03
Study tip
Don't forget to add state symbols!
Balancing formulae with brackets
Take care when balancing formulae with brackets. Remember that the
balancing number multiplies the entire formula.
3 Zn(NO3), means 3 x Zn(NO3)2
This gives 3 Zn, 3 x 2 = 6 N, and 3 x 3 x 2 = 18 0

Every two years, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
(IUPAC) reviews values for relative atomic masses for use across the world.
The review usually results in some very small adjustments, but the 2011
review made a more fundamental change. It has been known for many years
that the isotopic abundances of an element may vary slightly depending on
where the sample originates. In 2011, IUPAC published a new periodic table to
take into account this variation by showing the relative atomic mass of some
elements as a range rather than a single value. Figure 4 shows an extract
from this periodic table. Compare the relative atomic masses of silicon and
sulfur in Figure 2 and Figure 5. This change does not really affect the values
used at A Level, but atomic masses shown to greater accuracy are affected,
and future reviews may affect other elements.

Every periodic table shows each
element labelled with its atomic

access to a copy of the periodic
table. Using the periodic table, you
will always be able to work out the

Unlike protons, the number of neutrons in the atoms of an element

Other ways of representing isotopes
Chemists refer to isotopes in different ways, so you may see an isotope
of oxygen written as 160, 160, or simply as oxygen-16. All oxyger
atoms contain eight protons, so if the '8' is omitted, as in 160 and
oxygen-16, you still know how many protons the isotope contains.
Isotopes and chemical reactions
Chemical reactions involve the electrons surrounding the nucleus.
• Different isotopes of the same element have the same number of
electrons.
The number of neutrons has no effect on reactions of an element.
Different isotopes of an element therefore react in the same way.
There may be small differences in physical properties – with higher-mass
isotopes of an element having a higher melting point, boiling point, and
density - but the chemical reactions are the same.

At GCSE, you learnt about the nuclear model of the atom (Figure 1).

A third type of subatomic particle, called an electron, occupies
a region outside the nucleus. Electrons are arranged around the
nucleus in shells.

Properties of protons, neutrons, and electrons

Atoms and their subatomic particles have tiny masses. Instead of
working in grams, chemists compare the masses of subatomic particles
using relative masses (Figure 2).

A proton has virtually the same mass as a neutron.
• An electron has negligible mass, about oth the mass of a proton.

Accurate measurements show that a neutron has a slightly greater mass

usually assume that protons and neutrons have the same mass.

electron. The charges balance.
A neutron, as its name suggests, is neutral and has no charge.

The actual charge on a single proton is tiny: +1.60217733 x 10-1°C
(coulombs). The charge on a single electron must balance the charge
on a proton and is -1.60217733 x 10-1°C. It is much easier to use
relative charges of 1+ for a proton and l- for an electron.
Building the atom
Table 1 summarises the relative charges and masses of protons,
neutrons, and electrons.
Nearly all of an atom's mass is in the nucleus.
Atoms contain the same number of protons as electrons.

Ionic charges
To study chemistry successfully at any level, you need to be able to
write chemical formulae and construct balanced chemical equations.
In this topic, you will review how to write the formula of an ionic
compound from ionic charges and how to balance chemical equations.

Simple ions from the periodic table
You should remember from GCSE that many atoms lose or gain
electrons to achieve the same electron structure as the nearest noble
gas, helium (He) to radon (Rn).
Atoms of metals on the left of the periodic table lose electrons to
form cations (positive ions)
Atoms of non-metals on the right of the periodic table gain
electrons to form anions (negative ions).

Electron structure and ionic bonding
will be developed later in Topic 5.1,
Electron structure and Topic 5.2,
lonic bonding and structure.
For many elements you can use the element's position in the periodic
table to work out the likely charge on the ion, as shown in Figure 1.

To name a binary compound, use the name of the first element but
change the ending of the second element's name to -ide.

Polyatomic ions
Sometimes, an ion may contain atoms of more than one element
bonded together. These ions are called polyatomic ions. Table 1

Writing formulae from ions
An ionic compound contains a cation and an anion. The formula can
be worked out from the charge on each ion.
In a correct formula:
the overall charge is zero so the ionic charges must balance
sum of positive charges = sum of negative charges.
A) Worked example: lonic formulae
Compound name Ions present Balance charges
zinc chloride
Zn2+ and Cl-
1 Zn2+ ions balances 2 Cl-ions
aluminium sulfate Al3+ and 50,- 2 AB+ ions balance 3 50,- ions
The charges must balance, but it's just a matter of multiplication tables.
1 Zn2+ (1 2+ = 2+) is balanced by 2 C1- (2 1- = 2-)
2 Al3+ (2 X 3+ = 6+) is balanced by 3 80,- (3 x 2- = 6-)
Formula
ZnCl2
Al2(SO4)3
Writing the formula
• The number of each ion present is shown as a subscript after
the ion.
The ionic charges are usually omitted in the completed formula.
• Brackets are used if there is more than one polyatomic ion.
Aluminium sulfate contains 2 Al3+ ions and 3 SO, 2-ions and so the
formula is Al2(SO4)3
