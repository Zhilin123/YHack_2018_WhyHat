Infrared spectrum of an alcohol
The IR spectrum of an alcohol has an absorbance peak within the
range 3200–3600 cm-' caused by the 0-H bond in an alcohol.
There is also a peak between 1000-1300 cm-l caused by the C-0
bond, though this peak is often difficult to assign because of the many
other peaks in the fingerprint region. The IR spectrum of propan-2-ol,
CH, CHOHCH,, is shown in Figure 5.

Infrared spectrum of a carboxylic acid
The IR spectrum of carboxylic acid has a key absorbance peak within
the range 1630-1820 cm-l caused by the CEO bond, and a broad peak

As with aldehydes and ketones, the CEO peak typically absorbs close

the C-0 bond. The C-0 peak is not always reliable, as it is in the

Applications of infrared spectroscopy
Many pollutants can be identified by their IR spectral fingerprints.
Remote sensors analyse the IR spectra of vehicle emissions to detect
and measure carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons in
busy town centres or by motorways to monitor localised pollution.
A Figure 8 Infrared spectroscopy is
also used in roadside breathalysers to
detect ethanol
IR-based breathalysers pass a beam of IR radiation through the
captured breath in the sample chamber and detect the IR absorbance
of the compounds in the breath. The characteristic bonds present in
ethanol are detected. The more IR radiation absorbed, the higher the
reading, and the more ethanol in the breath.
Putting it all together
In this chapter, you have found out how organic chemists make use
of infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry for obtaining different
information about an organic compound.

Drug testing in sport
During the London Olympics, a team of 150 scientists analysed more
than 6000 samples in an attempt to ensure that the games were not tainted
by disqualifications due to the use of prohibited drugs. The London anti-doping
laboratory operated by GlaxoSmithKline and King's College London was
operational for 24 hours a day throughout both the Olympics and Paralympics.
Every medal winner was automatically tested, and many random tests
were carried out both in Olympic venues and within the accommodation in
the Olympic Village. The state-of-the-art laboratories employed a number of
analytical techniques including mass spectrometry to test urine samples. This
technique, along with many others, is used to ensure that every athlete is 'clean'.
In the Athens Olympics of 2004, twenty-four doping violations were uncovered.

A typical sequence for identification would include all of the following.
• Elemental analysis - use of percentage composition data to

Mass spectrometry - use of the molecular ion peak from a mass
spectrum to determine the molecular mass; use of fragment ions to
identify sections of a molecule.
Infrared spectroscopy - use of absorption peaks from an
infrared spectrum to identify bonds and functional groups present
in the molecule.
Once you have both the empirical formula and the molecular mass

techniques.
Infrared radiation and covalent bonds
Atoms in molecules are joined by covalent bonds. These bonds possess
energy and vibrate naturally about a central point, the amount of
vibration increasing with increasing temperature. The atoms in
molecules are therefore in constant motion. The bonds can absorb
infrared (IR) radiation, which makes them bend or stretch more.
One type of vibration, a stretch, is a rhythmic movement along the
line between the atoms so that the distance between the two atomic
centres increases and decreases (Figure 1). If you take A level physics,
the vibration is similar to the simple harmonic motion of a spring.
The second type of vibration, a bend, results in a change in bond
angle, as shown in Figure 2.
The amount that a bond stretches or bends depends on:
the mass of the atoms in the bond - heavier atoms vibrate more
slowly than lighter atoms
• the strength of the bond - stronger bonds vibrate faster than
weaker bonds.
Figure 1 A bond in a molecule can
stretch so that the distance between
the atomic centres changes
Any particular bond can only absorb radiation that has the same
frequency as the natural frequency of the bond. The frequency
values are very large, so chemists use a more convenient scale called
wavenumber, which is proportional to frequency. The vibrations of
most bonds are observed in the IR wavenumber range of 200 cm-1
to 4000 cm-.
bond angle decreases
Infrared radiation and atmospheric gases
Much of the Sun's visible and IR radiation is relatively unaffected by
atmospheric gases. This radiation passes through the atmosphere
to the Earth's surface, where most of it is absorbed. However, some
is re-emitted from the Earth's surface in the form of longer-wavelength
IR radiation.
bond angle increases
A Figure 2 Bonds in a molecule can
bend, causing the bond angle to change
Water vapour, carbon dioxide, and methane ('greenhouse gases')
absorb this longer-wavelength IR radiation, because it has the same
frequency as the natural frequency of their bonds. Eventually, the
vibrating bonds in these molecules re-emit this energy as radiation
that increases the temperature of the atmosphere close to the Earth's
surface, leading to global warming.

17.2 Infrared spectroscopy
The infrared spectra of common functional groups
It is difficult to predict with certainty the identity of a functional group
from a peak in the fingerprint region but, outside that region, peaks are
clearer. Chemists have studied the IR spectra of thousands of organic
molecules and have developed tables of data to help identify a particular
functional group in an unknown molecule. The OCR data table for IR
spectroscopy is shown in Table 1.

C=O group in aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids
• COOH group in carboxylic acids.
Study tip
When interpreting IR spectra it is
important to identify both the
bond and the functional group to
which it belongs. For example, the
0-H bond in an alcohol.
You should also be aware that all organic compounds produce a
characteristic peak between 2850 and 3100 cm-l from the presence of
C-H bonds. This is often confused with the 0-H peak in alcohols, so
you will need to take care.

The sample under investigation is placed inside an IR spectrometer.
A beam of IR radiation in the range 200-4000 cm-' is passed
through the sample.
The molecule absorbs some of the IR frequencies, and the
emerging beam of radiation is analysed to identify the frequencies
that have been absorbed by the sample.
The IR spectrometer is usually connected to a computer that plots
a graph of transmittance against wavenumber.
A typical IR spectrum is shown in Figure 4. The dips in the graph are
still called 'peaks'. Each peak is observed at a wavenumber that can be
related to a particular bond in the molecule.

propan-1-ol has a molecular mass of 60, but a small proportion of
the alcohol molecules will contain an atom of 13C and thus have a
molecular mass of 61. This gives the small M+1 peak.
Fragmentation
In the mass spectrometer some molecular ions break down into
smaller pieces known as fragments in a process called fragmentation.
The other peaks in a mass spectrum are caused by fragment ions,
formed from the breakdown of the molecular ion.
The simplest fragmentation breaks a molecular ion into two species - a
positively charged fragment ion and a radical. Any positive ions formed
will be detected by the mass spectrometer, but the uncharged radicals are
not detected. In the mass spectrum for propan-1-ol (Figure 2), the largest
peak has an m/z value of 31. The equation below shows the possible
identity of this fragment ion and its formation from the molecular ion.
CH,CH,CH,OH+ + CH,OH+ + CH,CH

m/z = 31
You should be able to see how the molecular ion could break to form
fragment ion and radical.
Using fragmentation peaks to identify an organic molecule
The mass spectrum of each compound is unique, as molecules will
all fragment in slightly different ways depending on their structures.
Mass spectra can therefore be used to help identify molecules. So even
though two molecules may have the same molecular mass and the
same molecular ion peak, the fragment ions found in the spectrum
may be different.
Figure 3 shows the different mass spectra of hexane and
2-methylpentane - two isomers of C H 4. Both spectra have the
molecular ion peak at 86, which is the molecular mass of both hexane
and 2-methylpentane, but the fragmentation patterns are different.

loses an electron and forms a positive ion, the molecular ion. The
mass spectrometer detects the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the
molecular ion which gives the molecular mass of the compound.
