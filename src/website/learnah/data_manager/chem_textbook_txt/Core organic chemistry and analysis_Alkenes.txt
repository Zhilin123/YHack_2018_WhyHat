Identifying monomers from polymer chains
Once you have identified the repeat unit in a polymer, you should be
able to identify the original monomer from which the polymer was
made. For example, the structure of poly(methyl methacrylate), a glass
substitute used as perspex, is shown in Figure 7 with its repeat unit
shaded. The monomer can be identified by copying the shaded repeat
unit and changing the single C-C bond in the chain into a double bond.

It does not matter how complicated
the polymer looks. Look at the chain
and see where it repeats. Then you
will be able to identify the monomer
from its polymer.
Environmental concerns
Disposing of waste polymers
Polymers are readily available, cheap to purchase, and more
convenient for our throwaway society than the alternatives, such as
glass bottles, metal dustbins, paper bags, and cardboard packaging.
The lack of reactivity that makes polymers suitable for storing food
and chemicals safely also presents chemists with a challenge in their
disposal. Many alkene-based polymers are non-biodegradable. The
growing amount of polymer waste has serious environmental effects,
for example, killing marine life.
Recycling
Recycling polymers reduces their environmental impact by conserving
finite fossil fuels as well as decreasing the amount of waste going to
landfill. Discarded polymers have to be sorted by type. The recycling
process is undermined if polymers are mixed as this renders the product
unusable. Once sorted, the polymers are chopped into flakes, washed,
dried, and melted. The recycled polymer is cut into pellets and used by
manufacturers to make new products.
Figure 8 Waste polymers can wrap
around marine life, suffocating them
PVC recycling
The disposal and recycling of PVC is hazardous due to the high chlorine
content and the range of additives present in the polymer. Dumping PVC
in landfill is not sustainable and, when burnt, PVC releases hydrogen
chloride, a corrosive gas, and other pollutants like toxic dioxins.
Previously, recycling involved grinding PVC and reusing it to
manufacture new products. New technology uses solvents to dissolve
the polymer. High-grade PVC is then recovered by precipitation from
the solvent, and the solvent is used again.
A Figure 9 Plastic bottles are sorted
based on their resin identification codes
Using waste polymers as fuel
Some polymers are difficult to recycle. As they are derived from
petroleum or natural gas, they have a high stored energy value. Waste
polymers can be incinerated to produce heat, generating steam to
drive a turbine producing electricity. In Sheffield an energy recovery
facility incinerates non-recyclable material including waste polymers
and uses the heat to generate electricity for the National Grid and to
heat buildings across the city centre.
Feedstock recycling
Feedstock recycling describes the chemical and thermal processes
that can reclaim monomers, gases, or oil from waste polymers. The
products from feedstock recycling resemble those produced from
crude oil in refineries. These materials can be used as raw materials
for the production of new polymers. A major advantage
of feedstock recycling is that it is able to handle unsorted and
unwashed polymers.

Focus on margarine
Margarine (Figure 4) was created in the early 1800s as an inexpensive substitute for butter. Early margarines were
made from animal fat. However, in the 1900s, chemists discovered how to harden liquid oils, and vegetable oil replaced
animal fat in margarine production.
Vegetable oil (Figure 5) contains molecules with long unsaturated
hydrocarbon chains with the C=C bonds in the cis orientation. Hydrogen
gas is bubbled through the oil in the presence of a catalyst (usually nickel).
Many of the unsaturated double bonds are hydrogenated to form saturated
carbon chains. The hydrogenated products have a lower melting point, so
are more solid. The more complete the hydrogenation process, the firmer
the finished margarine product.
A Figure 4 Margarine
The hydrogenation process does actually also form some trans double
bonds. As the catalyst works, the T-bond is first broken but it then can
reform in the trans orientation. As with saturated fats, trans fats have a
lower melting point than cis fats. There are health concerns arising from
trans fats and manufacturers are trying to reduce their formation. Labels on
margarines sometimes state 'low in trans fats'.

13.3 Reactions of alkenes
Specification reference: 4.1.3
The reactivity of alkenes
Alkenes are much more reactive than alkanes because of the presence
of the r-bond. You learnt in Topic 13.1 that the C=C double bond is
made up of a o-bond and a n-bond, and that the t-electron density
is concentrated above and below the plane of the o-bond (Figure 1).
Being on the outside of the double bond, the 7-electrons are more
exposed than the electrons in the o-bond. A 1-bond readily breaks
and alkenes undergo addition reactions relatively easily.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
► the reactivity of alkenes
► the addition reactions of
alkenes.
By considering the exposed nature of the -electrons and the bond
enthalpy data below, it is easy to see why the T-bond breaks and
the o-bond remains intact when alkenes react.
CAC
AN
o-bond
T-bond
AC-C single bond (o-bond) in ethene has a bond enthalpy of
347 kJ mol-1
The C=C double bond (o-bond + T-bond) has a bond enthalpy of
612 kJ mol-1
The bond enthalpy of the T-bond in an alkene can be calculated
as 612 - 347 = 265 kJ mol-!.
The T-bond is weaker than the o-bond and is therefore broken
more readily.
A Figure 1 The double bond in an
alkene is made of a o-bond and a
T-bond; the T-electrons are on the
outside of the double bond
Synoptic link
Addition reactions of the alkenes
Alkenes undergo many addition reactions For example, with:
• hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst
halogens
hydrogen halides
steam in the presence of an acid catalyst.
You have learnt about addition
reactions in Topic 11.5, Introduction
to reaction mechanisms.
Each of these reactions involves the addition of a small molecule
across the double bond, causing the n-bond to break and for new
bonds to form.
Hydrogenation of alkenes
When an alkene, such as propene, is mixed with hydrogen and passed
over a nickel catalyst at 423K, an addition reaction takes place to form
an alkane (Figure 2). This addition reaction, in which hydrogen is
added across a double bond, is known as hydrogenation.
Study tip
An addition reaction is one in which
two molecules react together to
make one product. The product is
saturated.

Biodegradable and photodegradable polymers
Bioplastics produced from plant starch, cellulose, plant oils, and
proteins offer a renewable and sustainable alternative to oil-based
products. The use of bioplastics not only protects our environment but
also conserves valuable oil reserves.
Biodegradable polymers
Biodegradable polymers are broken down by microorganisms into water,
carbon dioxide, and biological compounds. These polymers are usually
made from starch or cellulose, or contain additives that alter the structure
of traditional polymers so that microorganisms can break them down.
Compostable polymers degrade and leave no visible or toxic residues.
Compostable polymers based on poly(lactic acid) (Figure 11) are
becoming more common as an alternative to alkene-based polymers.
Supermarket bags made from plant starch can be used as bin liners
for food waste so that the waste and bag can be composted together.
Compostable plates, cups, and food trays made from sugar cane fibre
are replacing expanded polystyrene. As the technology advances,
bioplastics are likely to be more extensively used in packaging,
electronics, and more fuel-efficient and recyclable vehicles.

13.2 Stereoisomerism
Study tip
If a molecule satisfies both of the following conditions it will have
E/Z isomerism:
a C=C double bond
• different groups attached to each carbon atom of the double bond.
You may be asked whether a
structure has E/Z isomerism.
Many students remember the first
condition, the double bond, but not
the second, different groups. You
need both conditions.
Both but-1-ene and but-2-ene (Figure 4) contain a C=C bond,
but only but-2-ene can form E/Z isomers. If you examine the two
structures you can see why.
H
H3C
In but-1-ene, the carbon atom on the left-hand side of the molecule
is attached to two hydrogen atoms. This means that its structure does
not satisfy the second condition. In contrast, but-2-ene has a methyl
group and a hydrogen atom on each of the carbon atoms of the
double bond, so it has E and Z isomers (Figure 5).

Cis-trans isomerism
Cis-trans isomerism is the name commonly used to describe a special
case of E/Z isomerism. Molecules must have a C=C double bond and
each carbon in the double bond must be attached to two different
groups, as for all E/Z isomers. However, in cis-trans isomers one of
the attached groups on each carbon atom of the double bond must be
hydrogen.

Testing for unsaturation
The reaction of alkenes with bromine can be used to identify if there
is a C=C bond present and the organic compound is unsaturated.
When bromine water (an orange solution) is added dropwise to a
sample of an alkene, bromine adds across the double bond. The orange
colour disappears (Figure 6), indicating the presence of a C=C bond.
If the same test is carried out with a saturated compound, there is no
addition reaction and no colour change. Any compound containing a
C=C bond will decolourise bromine water.
Addition reactions of alkenes with hydrogen halides
Alkenes react with gaseous hydrogen halides at room temperature to
form haloalkanes. If the alkene is a gas, like ethene, then the reaction
takes place when the two gases are mixed. If the alkene is a liquid,
then the hydrogen halide is bubbled through it. Alkenes also react
with concentrated hydrochloric or concentrated hydrobromic acid,
which are solutions of the hydrogen halides in water.

Stereoisomers
Stereoisomers have the same structural formula but a different
arrangement of the atoms in space. You will study two types of
stereoisomerism, E/Z isomerism and optical isomerism. E/Z
isomerism only occurs in compounds with a C=C double bond,
whereas optical isomerism can occur in a much wider range of
compounds, including alkanes with no functional groups.

Solving the mystery of maleic and fumaric acid
Maleic acid can be isolated from unripe fruit (especially
tomatoes and apples) and fumaric acid is isolated from a wild
flower. Both acids have the structural formula HOOCCH=CHCOOH
and contain the same functional groups, yet they behave
differently when heated. This difference puzzled chemists
for some time. In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff, a Dutch
chemist, proposed that free rotation around a double bond
was not possible. He concluded that two molecules with the
same structural formula could exist in two different forms
(Figure 1). He called these two forms of the same structure
cis and trans (Latin for 'same side' and across'), terms that
are still in use today. He was awarded the first Nobel Prize in
chemistry in 1901 in recognition of his contribution to the field
of stereochemistry.

E/Z isomerism
Stereoisomerism around double bonds arises because rotation about
the double bond is restricted and the groups attached to each carbon
atom are therefore fixed relative to each other. The reason for the
rigidity is the position of the a-bond's electron density above and
below the plane of the o-bond (see Topic 13.1).

13.4 Electrophilic addition
in alkenes
Specification reference: 4.1.3
Electrophilic addition reactions
In Topic 11.5, you found out that a reaction mechanism is a series of
steps that shows how a reaction takes place. Alkenes usually take part
in addition reactions to form saturated compounds. The mechanism
for this reaction is called electrophilic addition.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
→ electrophiles
→ mechanism of electrophilic
addition in alkenes
→ Markownikoff's rule.
•
The double bond in an alkene represents a region of high electron
density because of the presence of the T-electrons.
The high electron density of the 7-electrons attracts electrophiles.
An electrophile is an atom or group of atoms that is attracted to an
electron-rich centre and accepts an electron pair. An electrophile
is usually a positive ion or a molecule containing an atom with a
partial positive (+) charge.
Study tip
An electrophile is defined simply
as an electron pair acceptor.

A Figure 7 The structure of one stereo
isomer of 3-methylpent-2-ene
Up until 1951, the whole system of naming the isomers of compounds
containing C=C bonds was a complete mess. Some chemists would
have named this molecule cis, as the bigger groups on each carbon
atom are on the same side of the molecule. Other chemists would have
called it trans as the two methyl, CHz, groups are the same and are on
opposite sides of the molecule, diagonally across from each other.
Robert Sidney Cahn, Christopher Kelk Ingold, and Vladimir Prelog
sorted this out!
Using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules
In this system the atoms attached to each carbon atom in a double
bond are given a priority based upon their atomic number.
high priority
high priority
low priority

If the groups of higher priority are on the same side of the double
bond, the compound is the Z isomer.
If the groups of higher priority are diagonally placed across the
double bond, the compound is the E isomer.
(Z) - isomer

Assigning priority - step 1
Examine the atoms attached directly to the carbon atoms of the double
bond and decide which of the two atoms has the highest priority. The
higher the atomic number, the higher the priority.

Step 4: The molecule is called (E)-2-bromo-1-chloropropene.
Assigning priority - step 2
If the two atoms attached to a carbon atom in the double bond are
the same, then you will need to find the first point of difference. The
group which has the higher atomic number at the first point
of difference is given the higher priority.

Step 2: On the right-hand side, the atoms immediately attached to

Step 3: Continue down these two branches (marked in blue in
Figure 10) to the first point of difference in the two side
chains. This is at the Cl and O atoms (marked in red).
Step 4: Cl has a higher atomic number, so the chain containing
the CH CH CI has the higher priority.

6 In the final step the Brion reacts with the carbocation to form the

The reaction between propene and bromine
Hydrogen bromide is a polar molecule, so it is easy to see how it
acts as an electrophile in its reactions with the alkenes (Figure 2).
However, alkenes can also react with non-polar molecules, such as
bromine, Br, by electrophilic addition.
Bromine adds to propene to form a single addition product. The
equation for the reaction is shown in Figure 3.

The mechanism for the reaction
Bromine is a non-polar molecule. When bromine approaches an
alkene, the 7-electrons interact with the electrons in the Br-Br bond.

This interaction causes polarisation of the Br-Br bond, with one end
of the molecule becoming Brø+ and the other end of the molecule
becoming Bro-. This is known as an induced dipole (Figure 5).

pair going to the Bri- end of the molecule.
Abromide ion (Br) and a carbocation are formed.

You may come across many other

A Level chemistry course, but
the concepts will always be very

polymer, given the monomer.
Use the examples in Table 1 to
test your ability to draw the repeat
units of a polymer.
A Figure 3 Polymerisation of ethene monomers at
high temperature and pressure to prepare poly(ethene)
Poly(ethene) is one of the most commonly used polymers - you will
come across it in supermarket bags, shampoo bottles, and children's toys.
The history of polyethene
Poly(ethene) was made by accident by Eric Fawcett
and Reginald Gibson in 1933. They were carrying out
high-pressure experiments with ethene at a chemical
plant in Cheshire. A test vessel leaked, allowing a trace
of oxygen to contaminate a fresh sample of ethene.
The following day they found a white, waxy residue had
been produced.
poly(ethene) (HDPE) has linear chains. This gives the
plastic some strength, making it ideal for use in children's
toys, detergent bottles, and water pipes. Low density
poly(ethene) (LDPE) has branched chains. This results in
a plastic that has little strength but is flexible, making it
ideal for use in plastic films and plastic bags.
Nowadays poly(ethene) is manufactured in large
quantities using carefully controlled processes.
Depending on the method used, different densities of
poly(ethene) can be made that have different structures,
properties, and uses. For example high density
1 Why does HDPE have a greater density and greater
strength than LDPE?
2 The molecular mass of HDPE is typically in the
range 200 000-500 000. Estimate the number of
monomer units in this range.
Poly(chloroethene)
Poly(chloroethene), also known as poly(vinyl chloride) or PVC, can be
prepared to make a polymer that is flexible or rigid. The equation for
the formation of PVC is shown in Figure 5, and its common uses are
shown in Figure 6.

13.1 The properties of the alkenes
Alkenes in the natural world
Alkenes are responsible for making flamingos pink and for the
smell of oranges and lemons.
The colour of a flamingo's plumage is due to its diet. Flamingos
in the wild typically eat algae and crustaceans that contain
pigments called carotenoids. Enzymes in the liver convert the
carotenoids into pink and orange pigments deposited in the
feathers. Beta-carotene, shown in Figure 7, is a related chemical
that makes carrots orange, and is important because it is a
building block that our bodies use to manufacture vitamin A.
A Figure 6 Flamingos in search of crustaceans to eat
A Figure 7 Carotene and related alkenes are responsible for the colour of flamingo plumage
Limonene (Figure 8) is a cyclic alkene with the molecular
formula C.H. It is found naturally in the rinds of
citrus fruits and is largely responsible for the smell and
flavour of oranges and lemons. Limonene is also used in
perfumes and household cleaning products because
of its fragrance.

the three regions repel each other as far apart as possible, so the
bond angle around each carbon atom is 120°
all of the atoms are in the same plane.

o Worked example: But-2-en-1-ol
You can apply the electron-pair repulsion theory to but-2-en-1-ol,
which contains both alkene and alcohol functional groups, to
predict the shape and bond angles around different atoms.

This carbon atom has three bonded regions and forms a

This carbon atom has four bonded electron pairs, which repel
each other as far as they can, to give a tetrahedral shape with
bond angles of 109.50.
This oxygen atom has two bonded pairs and two lone pairs.
The lone pairs repel more than the bonded pairs and the
bond angle will be 104.5°. The two bonds therefore form a
non-linear arrangement around the oxygen atom.

Polymers
The Mayan civilisation in Central America is believed to be among
the first to find an application for polymers: in the sixteenth
century they were playing ball games using rubber collected from
local trees. The first synthetic polymer, known as Bakelite, was made
in 1907 by the Belgian Leo Bakeland in the USA, and was used as
an electrical insulator. It was not until the late 1920s that now-
common addition polymers such as poly(vinylchloride) (PVC) were
synthesised on a large scale.

Addition polymerisation
Polymers are extremely large molecules formed from many thousands
of repeat units of smaller molecules known as monomers. Unsaturated
alkene molecules undergo addition polymerisation to produce long
saturated chains containing no double bonds. Many different polymers
can be formed, each with its own specific properties depending on
the monomer used. Industrial polymerisation is carried out at high
temperature and high pressure using catalysts.
Addition polymers have high molecular masses.
• Synthetic polymers are usually named after the monomer that
reacts to form their giant molecules, prefixed by 'poly'.
A general equation can be written for any addition polymerisation
reaction (Figure 2). The equation must be balanced using the symbol n.

Study tip
A repeat unit is the specific arrangement of atoms in the polymer
molecule that repeats over and over again.
The repeat unit is always written in square brackets.
After the bracket you place a letter n to show that there is a large
number of repeats.
Make sure polymerisation equations
are balanced. You will need the letter
n before the monomer and outside
the bracket after the repeat unit in
the polymer.
Poly(ethene)
Addition polymers are usually made from one type of monomer unit.
For example the polymer poly(ethene) is made by heating a large
number of ethene monomers at high pressure (Figure 3).

ALKENES
Markownikoff's rule
You learnt in Topic 133 that two isomeric products are formed when
propene, an unsymmetrical alkene, reacts with hydrogen bromide,
also an unsymmetrical molecule. Now you will learn how to predict
which of the two possible isomers is the major product.
In 1870 Vladimir Vasilyevich Markownikoff, a Russian chemist, stated
that when a hydrogen halide reacts with an unsymmetrical alkene
the hydrogen of the hydrogen halide attaches itself to the carbon
atom of the alkene with the greater number of hydrogen atoms and
the smaller number of carbon atoms.
Electrophilic addition occurs in two steps. In the first step a carbocation
is formed. In the reaction between propene and a hydrogen halide,
two carbocations are possible - a primary and a secondary
carbocation (Figure 6). In the primary carbocation the positive charge
is on a carbon atom at the end of a chain. In the secondary carbocation
the positive charge is on a carbon atom with two carbon chains
attached
Study tip
A carbocation has a positive charge
on a carbon atom
When propene reacts with hydrogen bromide, the major product is
2-bromopropane, formed from the secondary carbocation. The yield of
1-bromopropane is much smaller.
Figure 6 shows two mechanisms for the reaction between propene and
hydrogen bromide. The top mechanism shows a primary carbocation as
the intermediate. The lower mechanism shows a secondary carbocation
as the intermediate. To understand the different yields of the two
isomers, you need to consider the stability of carbocations.

Carbocation stability
Carbocations are classified by the number of alkyl groups attached to the
positively charged carbon atom (Figure 7). An alkyl group is normally
represented by the symbol -R. Tertiary carbocations with three R groups)
are the most stable, and primary carbocations are the least stable.
Carbocation stability is linked to the electron-donating ability of alkyl
groups. Each alkyl group donates and pushes electrons towards the
positive charge of the carbocation. The positive charge is spread over the
alkyl groups. The more alkyl groups attached to the positively-charged
carbon atom, the more the charge is spread out, making the ion more
stable. Therefore tertiary carbocations are more stable than secondary
carbocations, which are more stable than primary carbocations.
Addition of a hydrogen halide to an unsymmetrical alkene forms the
major product via the most stable carbocation.

The nature of the double bond
Each carbon atom has four electrons in its outer shell and can use
these electrons to form bonds.
Synoptic link
You met sigma bonds (o-bonds) in
Topic 12.1, Properties of alkanes.
For each carbon atom of the double bond, three of the four electrons are
used in three o-bonds, one to the other carbon atom of the double bond
and the other two electrons to two other atoms (carbon or hydrogen).
This leaves one electron on each carbon atom of the double bond not
involved in o-bonds. This electron is in a p-orbital. A A-bond is formed
by the sideways overlap of two p-orbitals, one from each carbon atom
of the double bond. Each carbon atom contributes one electron to the
electron pair in the a-bond. The n-electron density is concentrated
above and below the line joining the nuclei of the bonding atoms.
The T-bond locks the two carbon atoms in position and prevents them
from rotating around the double bond. This makes the geometry of the
