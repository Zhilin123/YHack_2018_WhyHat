Cold packs - where does the heat go?
Cold packs are used for sporting injuries to reduce swelling to muscles and
sprains. They are made of a pouch containing two compartments - one
containing a chemical, the other water. The cold pack is activated by squeezing
the pack to break the seal between the two compartments. The pack is then
shaken vigorously. The chemical dissolves in the water, cooling the pack and the
area around the injury.
Various chemicals can be used, the most common being the ionic compound
ammonium nitrate, NH, NOZ-

Successive electron affinities
The example for magnesium chloride included two ionisation energies

charge than 1-, such as 02-, successive electron affinities are required.

Dissolving ionic compounds
Water molecules are able to break up the giant ionic lattice structure and
overcome the strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely-charged
ions. This is what happens when salt dissolves in water.
Synoptic link
Enthalpy change of solution
The overall energy change associated with the dissolving process is
called the enthalpy change of solution.
The standard enthalpy change of solution A H® is the enthalpy
change that takes place when one mole of a solute dissolves in a
solvent. If the solvent is water, the ions from the ionic lattice finish up
surrounded with water molecules as aqueous ions.
The equation below represents the enthalpy change of solution of sodium
chloride in water. In the equation, aq represents an excess of water.

The enthalpy change of solution can be exothermic or endothermic.

lonic compounds
Ionic compounds tend to have the following general properties:
• high melting and boiling points
soluble in polar solvents
conduct electricity when molten or in aqueous solution.
Amongst the many ionic compounds, there is actually a wide range in
melting points and solubilities.
Synoptic link
In Topic 5.2, lonic bonding and
structure, you learnt about the
giant ionic lattice structures and
their properties.
Some ionic compounds can be melted with the heat of a Bunsen
burner, whilst others have such high melting points that they can
be used to coat the inside of furnaces. There are even some ionic
compounds that are liquids at room temperature - these are called
ionic liquids.
Although many ionic compounds are soluble in polar solvents such as
water, others are insoluble.
The relative magnitude of lattice and hydration enthalpies helps
to explain the variety of melting and boiling points and trends in
solubility seen in ionic solids.
Factors affecting lattice enthalpy
The values of lattice enthalpies depend upon ionic size and ionic
charge.
Effect of ionic size
The effect of increasing ionic size can be seen by comparing the lattice
enthalpies of Group 1 chlorides (Table 1).

Predicting melting points
The magnitude of lattice energy gives a good indication of the melting
point of an ionic compound, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Some
metal oxides, such as MgO, Al,0%, and Zro, have very exothermic
lattice enthalpies and very high melting points. These stable metal
oxides find a use as a protective coating for the inside of furnaces and
refractories. Lattice enthalpy is a very good indicator for the size of the
melting point but other factors, such as the packing of ions in an ionic
lattice, may need to be considered as well.

Predicting solubility
In Topic 22.2, Enthalpy changes
in solution, you learnt about the
energy processes involved in
dissolving an ionic compound.
To dissolve an ionic compound in water, the attraction between the
ions in the ionic lattice must be overcome. This requires a quantity of
energy equal to the lattice enthalpy. Water molecules are attracted to
the positive and negative ions, surrounding them and releasing energy
equal to hydration enthalpy.
If the sum of the hydration enthalpies is larger than the magnitude of
the lattice enthalpy, the overall enthalpy change (the enthalpy change
of solution) will be exothermic and the compound should dissolve.
Synoptic link
In Topic 22.5, Free energy, you will
find out why some endothermic
processes are able to take place on
their own at room temperature.
However, many compounds with endothermic enthalpy changes
of solution are soluble so this does not provide the total picture.
The reasons for solubility also depends on temperature and another
variable called entropy, which is discussed in the Topic 22.4 and 22.5.

Lattice enthalpy
Solid ionic compounds tend to be very stable - the stability arises
from the strength of the ionic bonds, electrostatic attractions
between oppositely-charged ions in the ionic lattice structure. This
creates a substantial energy barrier that must be overcome to break
down the lattice, reflected in the high melting points of many ionic
compounds. Lattice enthalpy is a measure of the strength of ionic
bonding in a giant ionic lattice.
Lattice enthalpy is the enthalpy change that accompanies the
formation of one mole of an ionic compound from its gaseous ions
under standard conditions. For example:

K+(g) + Cl (g) → KCl(s)
ALEH = -711 kJmol-1

Lattice enthalpy cannot be measured directly and must be
calculated indirectly using known energy changes in an energy
cycle. You have seen how to calculate enthalpy changes indirectly.
The indirect determination of lattice enthalpy requires a special
type of energy cycle called a Born-Haber cycle. Figure 2 shows

changes.
a gas spreading through a room
heat from a fire spreading through a room
ice melting in a hot room.
In all these examples, energy is being dispersed and becoming more
spread out. There is always a natural tendency for energy to spread
out rather than be concentrated in one place.
The greater the entropy, the greater the dispersal of energy and the
greater the disorder.
The term entropy is used for the dispersal of energy within the
chemicals making up the chemical system.
The units of entropy are JK-mol-!. The greater the entropy value, the
greater that energy is spread out per Kelvin per mole.
In general:
solids have the smallest entropies
liquids have greater entropies
gases have the greatest entropies.
These are very general rules though. Each state has substances that
can have very different entropies.
Predicting entropy changes
At OK, there would be no energy and all substances would have an
entropy value of zero. Above OK, energy becomes dispersed amongst
the particles and all substances have positive entropy.
Systems that are more chaotic have a higher entropy value.
• If a system changes to become more random, energy can be spread
out more - there will be an entropy change AS which will be
positive.
If a system changes to become less random, energy becomes more
concentrated – the entropy change AS will be negative.
In an equation for a physical or chemical change, you can predict
whether entropy increases or decreases by comparing the physical
states and amount of gas molecules on either side of an equation.
Changes of state
Entropy increases during changes in state that give a more random
arrangement of particles:

22.1 Lattice enthalpy
The first ionisation energy A H is the enthalpy change required to

form one mole of gaseous 1+ ions. For example:
A, H
= +496 kJ mol-1
Na(g) → Nat(g) + e-
gaseous gaseous
atoms 1+ ions
Study tip
You need to learn the definitions
for lattice enthalpy, first ionisation
energy, and enthalpy change
of formation only. For the other
enthalpy changes, you are not
required to recall the definition but
you must understand what the
energy changes are and use them
in constructing energy cycles and
in calculations.
Ionisation energies are endothermic because energy is required to
overcome the attraction between a negative electron and the
positive nucleus.
Electron affinity is the opposite of ionisation energy.
• Electron affinity measures the energy to gain electrons.
Ionisation energy measures the energy to lose electrons.
The first electron affinity AF H® is the enthalpy change that takes
place when one electron is added to each atom in one mole of gaseous
atoms to form one mole of gaseous l-ions. For example:
Cl(g) + e + Cl (g)
A H = -346 kJ mol-1
gaseous gaseous
atoms l-ions
First electron affinities are exothermic because the electron being added
is attracted in towards the nucleus.
Determination of lattice enthalpies
By constructing a full Born-Haber cycle you can calculate lattice
enthalpies.
O Worked example: Calculating the lattice enthalpy of
sodium chloride
You are provided with the following enthalpy changes.
Construct a Born-Haber cycle and calculate the lattice enthalpy
of sodium chloride, NaCl.

Route 1
Route 1 requires three different processes.
Formation of gaseous atoms:
Changing the elements in their standard states into gaseous atoms.
This change is endothermic as it involves bond breaking.
Formation of gaseous ions:
Changing the gaseous atoms into positive and negative
gaseous ions.
Overall, this change is endothermic.
Lattice formation:
Changing the gaseous ions into the solid ionic lattice.
This is the lattice enthalpy and is exothermic.
Route 2
Route 2 converts the elements in their standard states directly to the
ionic lattice. There is just one enthalpy change, the enthalpy change of

The standard enthalpy change of formation Ac HⓇ is the enthalpy
change that takes place when one mole of a compound is formed from
its elements under standard conditions, with all reactants and products
in their standard states.

The compound will always be an ionic compound in its solid lattice.
The standard enthalpy change of atomisation A H® is the enthalpy
change that takes place for the formation of one mole of gaseous atoms
from the element in its standard state under standard conditions.
Na(s) → Na(g) 4 HⓇ = +107 kJ mol-1
-C12(g) → Cl(g) 4 H = +121 kJ mol-1
element in Imole of
standard state gaseous atoms
4 H® is always an endothermic process because bonds are broken to
form gaseous atoms. When the element is a gas in its standard state,
4, H® is related to the bond enthalpy of the bond being broken.
For example, for CI,(g) 2Cl(g), a CL-Cl bond is being broken,
which has a bond enthalpy of +242 kJ mol-!. So for C12(g), the
enthalpy change is +121 kJ mol-?.

lonic liquids
You have learnt that ionic compounds generally have high melting and
boiling points, but ionic liquids have a low enough melting point that they
are liquids below 100 °C. So what is an ionic liquid?
Most ionic compounds have regular-shaped ions of reasonably similar size
so they can pack together tightly to form a solid ionic lattice.
In an ionic liquid, the ions can have irregular shapes and can be very
different sizes. This means that they are unable to pack together into a
lattice and can be liquids at room temperature.
lonic liquids conduct electricity, do not vaporise easily, and can dissolve
an amazing range of substances. The chemical structure of an ionic liquid
typically contains an organic ion as shown by the ionic liquid [EMIM]CI in
Figure 2. lonic liquids can be made from biomass, and are seen as potential
green solvents in the future to replace oil-derived solvents.

Diamonds are forever
... or are they?
Step 1: Calculate AS at 25°C.
AS = ES (products) - ES (reactants)
= { (SⓇ (K+) + (S® (CH) } - S(KCI)
= { 103 +57 } - 83 = +77 JK-mol-' = +0.077 kJK-mol-!
Step 2: Use Gibbs' equation to calculate AG at 25°C.
T = 273 + 25 = 298 K
AG = +16 - 298 x 0.077 = -7 kJ mol!
As AG < 0, the process is feasible.
You may have heard the phrase
'diamonds are forever', but this
is not quite correct. Diamond
and graphite are two different
structures of the same element,
carbon. Consider the free energy
for the conversion of diamond
into graphite:
C(s, diamond) — C(s, graphite)
AGⓇ = -3 kJ mol-1
As AGⓇ <0, the reaction for
converting diamond into
graphite is feasible!
Limitations of predictions made for feasibility
The free energy change is useful for predicting feasibility, but many
reactions have a negative AG and do not seem to take place.
For example, the equation for the decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide is shown below, together with its AG value at 25°C.
H,02(1)→ H20(1) + O2(g) AG = -117 kJ mol-1
But hydrogen peroxide does not decompose spontaneously at 25°C. So
why doesn't the reaction take place? The answer lies with the very large
activation energy resulting in a very slow rate. If hydrogen peroxide is
left for long enough, it would decompose. The reaction does take place
by addition of a trace of a Mno, catalyst, which allows the reaction to
take place via an alternative route with a lower activation energy. The
reduced energy barrier then allows the reaction to take place.
So, although the sign of AG indicates the thermodynamic feasibility, it
takes no account of the kinetics or rate of a reaction.

why do you not need to worry

ENTHALPY AND ENTROPY
So when any substance changes state from solid to liquid to gas, its
entropy increases:
• Melting and boiling increase the randomness of particles.
Energy is spread out more and AS is positive.
Figure 1 shows the values for the entropy S of the three states of H,O
and shows that the entropy change AS is positive as the molecules
become more disordered in changing from solid to liquid to gas.

Change in the number of gaseous molecules
Reactions that produce gases result in an increase in entropy, for
example, calcium carbonate reacting with hydrochloric acid:
Caco (s) + 2HCl(aq) +CaCl(aq) + CO,(g) + H2O(1)
Production of a gas increases the disorder of particles.
Energy is spread out more and AS is positive.
You can predict the sign of the entropy change for reactions where
the reactants and products have different numbers of gas molecules.
For example, the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen gases to produce
ammonia results in a decrease in the number of gas molecules:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH2(g)
4 moles of gas 2 moles of gas
There is a decrease in the randomness of particles.
• The energy is spread out less and AS is negative.

Standard entropies
Every substance has a standard entropy se, which can be found in
data books.
The standard entropy se of a substance is the entropy of one mole of a
substance, under standard conditions (100kPa and 298K).
Standard entropies have units of JK-mol-1.
Standard entropies are always positive.

The dissolving process
When a solid ionic compound dissolves in water, two processes take place
• the ionic lattice breaks up
water molecules are attracted to, and surround, the ions.
Two types of energy change are involved.
1 The ionic lattice is broken up forming separate gaseous ions.
This is the opposite energy change from lattice energy, which forms
the ionic lattice from gaseous ions.
Breaking up lattice:

AH = +788 kJ mol-1

2 The separate gaseous ions interact with polar water molecules to

the enthalpy change of hydration.
The enthalpy change of hydration Anya H is the enthalpy change that
accompanies the dissolving of gaseous ions in water to form one mole

Study tip
In the Gibbs' equation, the value and units of AS must be changed to
KJK-'mol- by dividing by 1000. This then matches the kJ in the AH.
To convert 25 °C to Kelvin, add 273:
25°C = 25 + 273
= 298 K
For the reaction of carbon and oxygen to form carbon dioxide, at 25°C:
AG = -393.5 - 298 x 0.9 = -393.8 kJ mol-1
* 1000
For many reactions at room temperature, AH has a much larger
magnitude that TAS and so AG is largely dependent on AH. As
temperature increases, the TAS term clearly becomes more important.
The worked example below shows how feasibility can change as
temperature increases and TAS becoming more significant.
Study tip
Ensure that the units are
consistent
AH: kJ mol-1 AS: JK-1 mol-1
) Worked example: Feasibility at different
temperatures
The AH and AS values for the decomposition of calcium carbonate
are shown below.
Convert AS into KJK-mol-1
To convert JK-1 mol-1 to
KJK-1mol-1, divide by 1000.
CaCO3(s) — CaO(s) + CO2(g)
AH = +178 kJ mol-1;
AS = 161JK-Imol-1
Remember that TAS uses
temperature in K, not °C.
Determine the feasibility of this reaction at 25°C and at 1000°C.
Step 1: Make units consistent.
Convert T to K:
T= 273 + 25 = 298 K
Convert AS to kJK-Imol-1: AS = 161
1000
= 0.161 kJK-l mol-1
Step 2: Use Gibbs' equation to calculate AG at 25°C.
AG = +178 - 298 x 0.161
= +130 kJ mol-1
As AG > 0, the reaction is not feasible at 25°C
Step 3: Use Gibbs' equation to calculate AG at 1000°C.
Figure 1 Alimestone quarry.
At high temperatures, limestone is
processed into cement which
contains calcium oxide
T = 273 + 1000 = 1273K
AG = AH - TAS
AG = +178 - 1273 x 0.161
= -27.0 kJmol-1
Study tip
For this reaction at 883 °C, AG = 0
As AG < 0, the reaction is feasible at 1000°C
The reaction can proceed at the high temperature of 1000°C. This
fits with the process for making calcium oxide (lime) by heating
calcium carbonate (limestone) in a furnace or lime kiln.
You should be able to prove this
using the Gibbs' equation.
At temperatures above 883 °C,
AG <0 and the reaction is feasible.
The worked example on the next
page shows how to calculate
the minimum temperature for a
reaction to be feasible.
At 25 °C, AG is positive.
The reaction is not feasible and does not take place.
Above 833°C (inside the lime kiln), AG is negative.
The reaction is feasible and does take place.

22.5 Free energy
Specification reference: 5.2.2
Why do reactions happen?
Feasibility
Some reactions happen whereas others do not. What factors control
whether a reaction is able to occur? The answer comes from energy
- a reaction can happen if the products have a lower overall energy
than the reactants. The term feasibility is used to describe whether
a reaction is able to happen and is energetically feasible. The word
spontaneous may also be used for energetically feasible.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
→ free energy
→ the Gibbs' equation
→ using free energy to predict
feasibility.
Free energy
The overall change in energy during a chemical reaction is called the
free energy change AG and is made up of two types of energy.
1
The enthalpy change AH. This is the heat transfer between the
chemical system and the surroundings.
The entropy change at the temperature of the reaction TAS. This is
the dispersal of energy within the chemical system itself.
2
The Gibbs' equation
The relationship between the two types of energy, AH and TAS, is
given by the Gibbs' equation.

Condition for feasibility
The feasibility of a reaction depends on the balance between AH and
TAS in the Gibbs' equation. For a reaction to be feasible, there must be
a decrease in free energy:
AG < 0
The value for AH is usually much larger than for AS and often
dominates the Gibbs' equation. Typically AH values are shown in
units of kJ mol-' whereas the much smaller AS values are shown
in units of JK-'mol-1. For example, the AH and AS values for the
reaction between carbon and oxygen to form carbon dioxide are
shown below.

When using the equation q = MCAT to calculate the energy change,
m is the mass that is changing temperature (where the thermometer
is). The thermometer is in the solution that is changing temperature
and so the mass should be the mass of the solution and not the mass
of water.
Whenever you carry out an enthalpy experiment, you should consider
what is changing temperature before using q = MCAT.

Show whether the reaction is feasible at 25°C. Calculate the
minimum temperature, in °C, for feasibility and whether this is a
realistic method for extracting aluminium from its ore.
The key to this problem is the Gibbs' equation. You will first need
to calculate AH and As for the reaction.
Step 1: Calculate AS.
AS = ES® (products) – ES® (reactants)
= { (2 x 5° (AI)) + (3 x 5° (CO)) } - {S® (A1,0z) + (3 x 5° (C))}
ASⓇ = {(2 x 28) + (3 x 198) }-{51 + (3 x 6) }
= +581 JK-mol-1

Refer back to Topic 22.4, Entropy,
for details of how to calculate an
entropy change of reaction from
standard entropies. Look back to
Topic 9.4, Hess' law and enthalpy
changes, for calculating an
enthalpy change of reaction from

Study tip
Although a full energy cycle could
have been used, here we are using
the convenient equation that links
AH with AH values for reactants
and products.
Step 2: Calculate AHⓇ.
AH = {H® (products) - CH® (reactants)
= (3 x 4,H (CO) - 4H® (A1,03)
AHⓇ = (3x-111 - (-1676) = +1343J mol-1
Step 3: Use the Gibbs' equation to calculate AG at 25°C.
Convert T to K: T = 273 + 25 = 298 K
Convert AS to KJK- mol-!
AS = 381 = 0.581 kJK-'mol-?
10000.d1 KJ Kºmol
AG = AH - TAS
AG = +1343 – 298 x 0.581 = +1170 kJ mol-1
As AG > 0, the reaction is not feasible.
Study tip
You need to remember to convert
the AS value into units of
kJ mol-1 K-1 to match the kJ in the
AH value. You cannot mix units. The
calculated AG value will have units
of kJ mol-1.
Step 4: Calculate the minimum temperature, in °C, for thermal
decomposition to take place.
At the minimum temperature for decomposition,
AG = AH - TAS = 0
rearrange AH – TAS = 0:
TAH
substitute AH and AS:
AS
I = 1343
+ 0.581
87 = 2312K
T= 2316 - 273 = 2039°C
convert K to °C:
The very high temperature makes the reduction of aluminium
oxide by carbon impracticable.

How can endothermic reactions take place at room
temperature?
Some ionic compounds dissolve in water at room temperature in
an endothermic process, cooling down the water. For example,
the enthalpy change of solution of potassium chloride, KCl(s), is
endothermic (AH = +16 kJ mol-1).
To find out why endothermic processes can take place at room
temperature, you need to use entropy and free energy. The worked
example below shows how an endothermic process can be feasible at
room temperature.
B Worked example: An endothermic feasible process
The enthalpy change and standard entropies for KCl(s), K+ (aq),
and Cl-(aq) are shown below.
KCl(s) → K+(aq) + CH(aq) AH = +16 kJ mol-1
