5.3 Covalent bonding
Specification reference: 2.2.2
Covalent bonding
Covalent compounds and molecules
Covalent bonding is the strong electrostatic attraction between a
shared pair of electrons and the nuclei of the bonded atoms. Covalent
bonding occurs between atoms in:
non-metallic elements, for example, H,
• compounds of non-metallic elements, for example, H,0 and CO2
polyatomic ions, for example, NH,*.
For covalent bonding, the key feature is the sharing of a pair of electrons
between the two atoms. The atoms are bonded together in a single
unit - a small molecule (e.g., H,), a giant covalent structure (e.g., SiO,),
or a charged polyatomic ion (e.g., NH,+). This is very different from the
model of electron transfer to form separate ions in ionic bonding.

In Topic 5.2, you saw that an ion attracts oppositely charged ions in
all directions, resulting in a giant ionic lattice structure containing
many billions of ions.

A covalent bond is very different. The attraction is localised, acting
solely between the shared pair of electrons and the nuclei of the two
bonded atoms. The result can be a small unit called a molecule,
consisting of two or more atoms, such as H, and H,O. A molecule
is the smallest part of a covalent compound that can exist whilst
retaining the chemical properties of the compound.

Electron configuration
Electron configuration of atoms
For A Level, you are expected to be able to work out the electron
configuration of atoms up to atomic number Z = 36 (krypton, Kr.) at
the end of Period 4 in the periodic table). The electron configuration of
an atom shows how sub-shells are occupied by electrons.
Electron configurations should be
shown in shell order rather than
the order of filling. So the electron
configuration of krypton should
show the 3d sub-shell before the 4s:
An atom of krypton, Z = 36, contains 36 electrons. In Figure 4, you
can see the energy levels of the sub-shells in the first four shells. Table
3 shows how the 36 electrons in a krypton atom fill the sub-shells
from the lowest energy level upwards.

of the previous noble gas in the periodic table plus the outer
electron sub-shells. Table 5 shows this shorthand notation for elements

similarities in the electron configurations of the outer shell.

For atoms of d-block elements, the 4s sub-shell is at a lower energy
than the 3d sub-shell, so is filled first. The energies of the 4s and
3d sub-shells are very close together and, once filled, the 3d energy
level falls below the 4s energy level. The consequence is that:
the 4s sub-shell fills before the 3d sub-shell
the 4s sub-shell also empties before the 3d sub-shell.

Dot-and-cross diagrams
As with ionic bonding, dot-and-cross diagrams are used to account for
electrons in covalent bonding.
•
.
In covalent bonding electrons are shared.
In ionic bonding electrons are transferred.
Figure 3 shows dot-and-cross diagrams for some simple molecules.
Use of dots and crosses allows the origin of each electron to be shown
clearly. Each bonding atom now has the electron structure of the
nearest noble gas.
Figure 3 also shows a second structure for each molecule called a
displayed formula.
A displayed formula shows the relative positioning of atoms and the
bonds between them as lines.
Paired electrons that are not shared are called lone pairs. These
can also be added to displayed formulae, as in water, H,O, and
ammonia, NHz, in Figure 3.

Structure of ionic compounds
Although it is convenient to look at ionic bonding acting between a small
number of ions, each ion attracts oppositely charged ions in all directions.
The result is a giant ionic lattice structure containing billions of
billions of ions, the actual number only determined by the size of the
crystal. The giant ionic lattice of sodium chloride is shown in Figure 4.
A giant lattice is a key structural feature of all ionic compounds.

Figure 6 shows the dot-and-cross diagram of sulfur hexafluoride, SF
In SF, six unpaired electrons from sulfur are paired.
The outer shell of sulfur now contains 12 electrons, far more than
the nearest noble gas, argon, Ar.
This is called expansion of the octet and is possible only from the
n = 3 shell, when a d-sub-shell becomes available for the expansion.

Multiple covalent bonds
A multiple covalent bond exist when two atoms share more than one
pair of electrons.
Synoptic link
You will learn more about the
nature of a single and double
covalent bond when you study
organic chemistry in Chapter 12,
Alkanes, and Chapter 13, Alkenes.
Double covalent bonds
In a double bond, the electrostatic attraction is between two shared
pairs of electrons and the nuclei of the bonding atoms.
Figure 7 shows dot-and-cross diagrams of double bonds in
molecules of oxygen (O=O) and carbon dioxide (O=C=O).
All atoms have eight electrons in their outer shell and the electron
structure of the nearest noble gas.
C=C and C=O double bonds are very important in organic chemistry.

pairs of electrons and the nuclei of the bonding atoms.

What about other elements?
Boron
Boron, in Period 2 of the periodic table, has the electron configuration
1s 2s22p', so only three outer-shell electrons can be paired. Boron
forms covalent compounds, such as boron trifluoride, BF (Figure 4),
in which its three outer-shell electrons are paired. So a molecule of
BF, only has six electrons around the boron atom.
A Figure 4 Dot-and-cross diagram of
boron trifluoride, BF, showing how the
three boron electrons are paired
BF, shows that predictions for bonding cannot be based solely on the
noble gas electron structure.
Phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine

phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine in Period 3 of the periodic table.

You can use Table 1 to work out the

fluoride. You studied oxidation

Formula of fluoride
Phosphorus trifluoride, PFz, sulfur difluoride, SF, and chlorine
monofluoride, CIF, follow the expected pattern of formulae, with the
bonded atoms having a noble gas electron structure. But how can
atoms of phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine bond with more fluorine
atoms to give the other fluorides in Table 1?
For the elements in Period 2, the n = 2 outer shell can hold just
eight electrons. But for phosphorus, sulfur, and fluorine, the n= 3
outer shell can hold 18 electrons, so more electrons are available
for bonding. Figure 5 shows how different arrangements for the
six outer-shell electrons of sulfur and the different numbers of bonds
possible to bond with fluorine.

Ionic bonding
Ionic bonding is the electrostatic attraction between positive and
negative ions. It holds together cations (positive ions) and anions
(negative ions) in ionic compounds.

• ammonium ions (NH4+).
Common anions include:
• non-metal ions (e.g., C1, 02-)
• polyatomic ions (e.g., NO3-, SO42-).
Synoptic link
In Topic 2.3, Formulae and
equations, you looked at how ionic
charges are used for writing the
formulae of ionic compounds.
Ionic compounds
Dot-and-cross diagrams
The simplest ionic compounds contain metal ions and non-metal ions.
At GCSE, you used a model for ionic bonding based on electron transfer.
• Outer-shell electrons from a metal atom are transferred to the
outer shell of a non-metal atom.
Positive and negative ions are formed.
The ions formed often have outer shells with the same electron
configuration as the nearest noble gas.
In dot-and-cross diagrams, the electrons in the original atoms are
shown as either dots or crosses. It is then easy to work out the charge
on each ion and to account for all electrons.
Example - potassium fluoride, KF
Figure 1 shows electron transfer of the one outer-shell electron in a
potassium atom, K, to the outer shell of a fluorine atom, F, forming
a K+ ion and an F-ion. The square brackets show that the charge is
spread over each ion and that the ions are separate entities. Only the
outer-shell electrons are shown because the inner shells are full and
not involved in bonding. The electron structures of the K+ and F-ions
formed are now the same as the nearest noble gas.

S-orbitals
In an s-orbital the electron cloud is within the shape of a sphere (Figure 2).
As with all orbitals, an s-orbital can hold one or two electrons.
Each shell from n = l contains one s-orbital.
The greater the shell number n, the greater the radius of its s-orbital.

p-orbitals
In a p-orbital, the electron cloud is within the shape of a dumb-bell. As
with an s-orbital, one orbital can contain one or two electrons. There
are three separate p-orbitals at right angles to one another (Figure 3).
These orbitals are referred to as Px Py, and pz.
Each shell from n = 2 contains three p-orbitals.
The greater the shell number n, the further the p-orbital is from
the nucleus.
d-orbitals and f-orbitals
The next orbitals, d- and f-orbitals, are more complex.
Each shell from n = 3 contains five d-orbitals.
Each shell from n = 4 contains seven f-orbitals.

5.1 Electron structure
Filling of orbitals
There is a set of rules for how orbitals are occupied by electrons.
Orbitals fill in order of increasing energy
The sub-shells that make up shells have slightly different energy
levels. Within each shell, the new type of sub-shell added has a
higher energy. For example, in the second shell, the 2p sub-shell is
the new type, and is at a higher energy than the 2s sub-shell.
n
=
4
.
in the n = 2 shell, the order of filling is 2s, 2p.
in the n = 3 shell, the order of filling is 3s, 3p, 3d.
in the n = 4 shell, the order of filling is 4s, 4p, 40, 4f.
energy
Figure 4 shows the relative energy levels of the sub-shells making up
the first four shells. The highest energy level in the third shell overlaps
with the lowest energy level in the fourth shell.
n=1 - Is
Figure 4 Energy levels of the sub-shells
The 3d sub-shell is at a higher energy level than the 4s sub-shell.
The 4s sub-shell therefore fills before the 3d sub-shell.
The order of filling is therefore 3p, 4s, 3d.
Electrons pair with opposite spins
Each orbital can hold up to two electrons. Rather than drawing different
orbital shapes, it is convenient to use an electrons-in-box model.
opposite spins
•
Electrons are negatively charged and repel one another.
Electrons have a property called spin - either up or down.
An electron is shown as an arrow indicating its spin, either | or .
The two electrons in an orbital must have opposite spins, as shown
in Figure 5. The opposite spins help to counteract the repulsion
between the negative charges of the two electrons.

Figure 5 'Electrons-in-box' model
showing allowed and unallowed spins
Orbitals with the same energy are occupied singly first
Within a sub-shell, the orbitals have the same energy. One electron
occupies each orbital before pairing starts. This prevents any repulsion
between paired electrons until there is no further orbital available at
the same energy level.
Figure 6 shows how four electrons occupy the p-orbitals of a p-sub-shell.

Electrons and shells
You already know that the nuclear atom contains electrons in shells
surrounding the nucleus. In this topic you will learn more about
how electrons are arranged within shells.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of: :
→ electrons and shells
→ atomic orbitals
→ filling of orbitals
→ electron configurations.
Shells
For GCSE, you learnt the 2,8,8 rule for the number of electrons that
can fill each shell.
For A Level, you need to know the number of electrons that fill the
first four shells (n=1 to n = 4) shown in Table 1.

electrons in the first four shells

What are shells?
In an atom, electron shells make up a model that helps us to visualise
something that cannot be seen.
Shells are regarded as energy levels.
The energy increases as the shell number increases.
The shell number or energy level number is called the principal
quantum number n.

Electrons in shells
The current model for an electron is based the idea that an
electron has properties both of a wave and a particle -
wave-particle duality. If you take A level physics, you will
learn more about wave-particle duality.
Around an atom, electrons can only fit into energy levels
defined by the wave nature of an electron.
The maximum number of electrons in a shell n is given by
the formula:
• number of electrons = 2n2
1 Use the 2nd formula to check the number of
electrons in Table 1.
2 Find out the maximum number electrons for the
energy levels n = 5, 6, and 7.
Atomic orbitals
Shells are made up of atomic orbitals. An atomic orbital is a region
around the nucleus that can hold up to two electrons, with opposite spins.
Models visualise an atomic orbital as a region in space where there is
a high probability of finding an electron (Figure 1). An electron can
be thought of as a negative-charge cloud with the shape of the orbital,
referred to as an electron cloud.
An orbital can hold one or two electrons, but no more.
There are different types of orbitals: S-, P-, d- and f-orbitals.
• Each type of orbital has a different shape.
This may seem bewildering, but you will soon see patterns emerge.

ELECTRONS AND BONDING

example, Figure 9 shows formation of an ammonium ion, NH +, by
reaction of ammonia, NH,, and a H+ ion.
.
An ammonia molecule donates its lone pair of electrons to a H+ ion.
The dative covalent bond in NH,+ is shown by a bond with an
arrowhead, to show that the nitrogen atom provides both
electrons to the covalent bond.
In an NH + ion, all four bonds are equivalent and you cannot tell
which is the dative covalent bond. The arrow for the dative covalent
bond (Figure 10) just helps with accounting for all electrons.

Average bond enthalpy
Average bond enthalpy serves as a measurement of covalent bond
strength. The larger the value of the average bond enthalpy, the stronger
the covalent bond. Table 2 shows some average bond enthalpies.

Table 1 Melting points of ionic
compounds
Melting and boiling points
Almost all ionic compounds are solids at room temperature. At room
temperature, there is insufficient energy to overcome the strong
electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions
in the giant ionic lattice. High temperatures are needed to provide the
large quantity of energy needed to overcome the strong electrostatic
attraction between the ions. Therefore most ionic compounds have
high melting and boiling points.

Table 1 compares the melting points of several ionic compounds.
The melting points are higher for lattices containing ions with greater
ionic charges, as there is stronger attraction between ions. Ionic
attraction also depends on the size of the ions, but in this example the
Na+ and Ca2+ ions are similar sizes so this is not a factor here.
Solubility
Many ionic compounds dissolve in polar solvents, such as water.
Polar water molecules break down the lattice and surround each ion
in solution.
In a compound made of ions with large charges, the ionic attraction
may be too strong for water to be able to break down the lattice
structure. The compound will not then be very soluble. Table 2
compares the solubility in water of several ionic compounds. The most
soluble compound.

A word of caution
Solubility requires two main processes:
the ionic lattice must be broken down
• water molecules must attract and surround the ions.
The solubility of an ionic compound in water therefore depends on
the relative strengths of the attractions within the giant ionic lattice
and the attractions between ions and water molecules. For the ionic
compounds in Table 2, the attractions in the giant ionic lattice have
the greater effect, and solubility decreases as ionic charge increases.
But predictions of solubility should be treated with caution.
Electrical conductivity
In the solid state, an ionic compound does not conduct electricity. But
once melted or dissolved in water, the ionic compound does conduct
electricity (Figure 5).

lonic bones and teeth
FLUORIDE
You rely on ionic compounds for the skeleton framework
of your body and for your teeth. So what are bones and
teeth made out of? The chemistry is complex but the
main ionic compound is calcium hydroxyapatite, which
can be represented with the formula Ca (PO),OH. This
compound is also the main constituent in tooth enamel.
Unfortunately ions in tooth enamel are removed in acid
conditions. Once broken down, gaps in enamel can allow
tooth decay to develop beneath. Saliva helps to neutralise
acidic food and also to replace ions but this may not
be enough. Fluoride ions help to replace lost ions by
forming fluoropatite, Ca(PO.),F, which is stronger than
hydroxyapatite and more resistant to acid conditions.

3 Many people confuse fluoride with fluorine. What is
the difference and why would it be very strange to
find fluorine in your toothpaste?
Most toothpastes contain fluoride as sodium fluoride.
Your water supply may also contain fluoride depending on
where you live.
