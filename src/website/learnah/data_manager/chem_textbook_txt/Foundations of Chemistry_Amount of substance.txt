In this topic, you will see how to use the results from chemical
experiments to work out a chemical formula.

Molecular formulae
Some compounds are made up of small units called molecules – two
or more atoms held together by covalent bonds. The molecular
formula is the number of atoms of each element in a molecule.
Table 1 Examples of compounds with
their empirical and molecular formulae
In Topic 2.3, Formulae and equations, you looked at the elements that
exist as molecules. In equations, these elements are shown as their
molecular formulae – H, N2, 02, F2, Cl, Brz, 12, P4, and Sg.
Many compounds also exist as molecules, and again the molecular
formula is used in equations.

Empirical formulae
The empirical formula is the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms
of each element in a compound.
H20
The empirical formula is important for substances that do not exist as
molecules. This includes metals, some non-metals (e.g., carbon, C,
and silicon, Si), and ionic compounds (e.g., sodium chloride, NaCl).
P,06
PO3
These substances form giant crystalline structures of atoms or ions.
C,H,203
CHO
It would be impossible to base a formula on the actual number of
atoms or ions - the numbers would go into billions of billions and
would vary depending on the size of the crystals.
The empirical formula is the ratio of atoms or ions in the structure and
will always be the same.
Figures 1 and 2 show giant crystalline structures of carbon and sodium
chloride. You will find out more about these structures later in the course.
More relative masses
Some compounds exist as simple molecules (e.g., water, H,O, and
carbon dioxide, CO,). Other compounds exist as giant crystalline
structures (e.g., all ionic compounds). Two terms are needed for relative
mass, one for simple molecules and another for giant structures.

structure of carbon atoms in a diamond

important role of carbon-12 in
atomic mass measurements in
Topic 2.2, Relative atomic mass.
Relative molecular mass
Relative molecular mass M, compares the mass of a molecule with
the mass of an atom of carbon-12. You can easily calculate a relative
molecular mass by adding together the relative atomic masses of the
elements making up a molecule. The examples below show how to
work out the relative molecular mass of molecules of water, H,O,
carbon dioxide, Cox, and glucose, CH 206

3.4 Reacting quantities
Reactions with high atom economies:
. produce a large proportion of desired products and few unwanted
waste products
are important for sustainability as they make the best use of
natural resources.
Atom economy is based solely on the balanced chemical equation for
a reaction and assumes a 100% yield.
sum of molar masses of desired products
atom economy =
- X 100%
sum of molar masses of all products
Study tip
Atom economy is worked out from
the balanced equation. Unlike
percentage yield, no experimental
results are needed.
The idea of atom economy has been developed alongside awareness
of dwindling finite resources and environmental concerns about
processing or disposing of harmful waste. Improving atom economy
makes industrial processes more efficient, preserves raw materials, and
reduces waste. In an ideal chemical process, a use would be found for
all products and thus the atom economy would be 100%.
) Worked example: Atom economy
Hydrogen is an important raw material and is produced from the
reaction of carbon with steam.
What is the atom economy of this reaction?
Study tip
Step 1: Write the equation and the molar masses of the products.
C(s) + 2H2O(g) + 2H2(g) + CO2(g)
— 2 x 2.0 12.0 + 16.0 x 2 = 44.0
Step 2: Calculate the atom economy.
sum of molar masses of desired products
atom economy =
x 100
sum of molar masses of all products
2 x 2.0 x 100 = 8.3%
2 x 2.0 + 44.0
Remember to take account of
the balancing numbers when
accounting for the sum of all molar
masses.
How sustainable?
The worked example reveals a poor atom economy, especially as the
calculation assumes a 100% yield of hydrogen – the overall yield will
be even worse. Furthermore, the undesired product is carbon dioxide,
one of the gases that causes global warming. So how sustainable is this
process?
Atom economy only provides part of the answer.
The process uses reactants that are readily available, carbon from
coal and steam from water. Energy will be needed to produce the
steam, but costs for obtaining starting materials are low.
Other reactions may have a much larger atom economy but poor
percentage yields. Efficiency will depend on both factors.

AMOUNT OF SUBSTANCE
6) Worked example: Percentage yield
1.15g of sodium reacts with an excess of chlorine, forming 1.872g of
sodium chloride. What is the percentage yield of sodium chloride?
Step 1: Calculate the amount, in moles, of Na that reacts.
n(Na) = m = 1;16 = 0.0500 mol
Step 2: Use the equation to find the theoretical yield of NaCl,
in moles.
equation 2 Na(s) + C1,(g) 2 NaCl(s)
moles 2 mol
2 mol
amounts 0.0500 mol
→ 0.0500 mol
Step 3: Calculate the actual yield of NaCl, in moles.
n(NaCl) – m
- 1.872

= 0.0320 mol
Step 4: Calculate the percentage yield of NaCl.
% yield -

X 100%
theoretical yield
0.0320 x 100 = 64.0%
0.0500
The limiting reagent
In the example above, you have used two reactants with one reactant
in excess. The reactant that is not in excess will be completely used up
first and stop the reaction - it is called the limiting reagent.
If you do not know which reactant is in excess, you need to find
out by working out the amount in moles of each reactant and
comparing with the equation. Calculations must be based on the
limiting reagent.
For example, when hydrogen and oxygen gases react to form water,
2 mol of hydrogen are required for every 1 mol of oxygen:
2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H,0(1)
2 mol Imol
If equal amounts of hydrogen and oxygen are allowed to react, hydrogen
will be used up first, and half the oxygen will be unreacted. The limiting
reagent is hydrogen, so calculations must be based on hydrogen.
Atom economy
The atom economy of a chemical reaction is a measure of how well
atoms have been utilised.

Molar mass
Molar mass, M, gives a convenient way of linking moles with mass
for any chemical substance.
M(C)
= 12.0 gmol-1.
M(NO) = 14.0 + 16.0 x 2
= 46.0 g mol-1
M(Na,Co) = 23.0 x 2 + 12.0 + 16.0 x 3 = 106.0 gmol-!.
Molar mass gives the mass in grams in each mole of the substance.
Molar mass is the mass per mole of a substance.

AMOUNT OF SUBSTANCE
3.1 Amount of substance and
the mole
Specification reference: 2.1.3
Counting and weighing atoms
Chemicals are usually measured by mass or volume. Because reactions
take place on an atomic scale, chemists need a method for converting
a measured mass or volume into the actual number of particles
involved in reactions.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
► the amount of substance,
the mole, and the Avogadro
constant
→ molar mass
→ calculations involving
masses and moles.
Amount of substance and the mole
Chemists use a quantity called amount of substance n to count
the number of particles in a substance, measured in a unit called
the mole mol. One mole is the amount of a substance that contains
6.02 x 1023 particles. The Avogadro constant N, is 6.02 x 1023 mol-,
the number of particles in each mole of carbon-12.
Synoptic link
You learnt about carbon-12 in
Topic 2.1, Relative mass.
The choice of 6.02 x 1023 particles per mole may seem strange, but
is directly linked to the mass of carbon-12, the standard for the
measurement of relative atomic masses. 12 g of carbon-12 contains
6.02 x 1023 atoms. You can easily find the mass of one mole (1 mol) of
atoms of any element - it is the relative atomic mass in grams.
Study tip
The mass of 1 mole of atoms of an
element equals the relative atomic
mass in grams
• One mole of carbon, C, atoms has a mass of 12.0g
One mole of hydrogen, H, atoms has a mass of 1.0g
One mole of magnesium, Mg, atoms has a mass of 24.3 g
• One mole of iron, Fe, atoms has a mass of 55.8g
So if you have a sample of an element and know its mass, you now
have a way of knowing the number of atoms. This is a very important
idea for chemistry - it offers an easy way of counting something that
cannot be seen, just by measuring the mass.
The Avogadro constant - amazingly large
It is difficult for us to comprehend the size of very large numbers.
If 6.02 x 1023 (I mol) pennies were shared evenly between all humans
on Earth, every person could spend £lm every hour for their whole life.

unambiguous name of a substance for clarity.

Percentage yield
So far, all our calculations have assumed that all of the reactants are
converted into products. This maximum possible amount of product is
called the theoretical yield. Unfortunately this is difficult to achieve for
several reasons, including:
the reaction may not have gone to completion
other reactions (side reactions) may have taken place alongside the
main reaction
purification of the product may result in loss of some product.
The actual yield obtained from a reaction is usually lower than the
theoretical yield. The conversion of starting materials into a desired
product is expressed by the percentage yield.

Finding a relative molecular mass
You can use the ideal gas equation to find the relative molecular mass of a
volatile liquid. Using the method below, the unknown compound would need

3.2 Determination of formulae
Hydrated salts
Many coloured crystals are hydrated – water molecules are part
of their crystalline structure. This water is known as water of
crystallisation. When blue crystals of hydrated copper(II) sulfate are
heated, bonds holding the water within the crystal are broken and
the water is driven off, leaving behind white anhydrous copper(II)
sulfate. The equation below represents the change when water is
removed. The water of crystallisation is shown in the formula of
hydrated copper (II) sulfate with a large dot. between the compound
formula and the five water units.

Without water, the crystalline structure is lost and a white powder
remains. It is difficult to remove the last traces of water, as you can

Relative formula mass
Relative formula mass compares the mass of a formula unit with
the mass of an atom of carbon-12. It is calculated by adding together
the relative atomic masses of the elements in the empirical formula, as
shown in the examples below.
NaCl = 23.0 + 35.5 = 58.5

Finding formulae by experiment
You can predict the formula of an ionic compound from its ions, but
if you do not know which ions are in a compound, the formula can
be worked out from the results of experiments. Investigating the
chemical composition of a substance is called analysis.
These worked examples show two common ways to calculate
empirical and molecular formulae from experimental mass readings.

How accurate is an experimental formula?
The application above gives a perfect formula for hydrated copper(II)
sulfate. Some assumptions have been made, and real experiments may
not always work out as well.
As part of the practical skills
required for your course, you need
to know how to measure mass,
volumes of solutions, and volumes
of gases.
Assumption 1 - All of the water has been lost
If the hydrated and anhydrous forms have different colours, you can
be fairly sure when all water has been removed. However you only see
the surface of the crystals and some water could be left inside. If the
hydrated and anhydrous forms are similar colours, it is not as easy.
A good solution is to heat to constant mass - the crystals are reheated
repeatedly until the mass of the residue no longer changes, suggesting
that all water has been removed.
This practical application box tells
you how to measure masses.
Measuring mass, volumes of
solutions, and volumes of gases
are also covered in:
Assumption 2 - No further decomposition
Many salts decompose further when heated; for example, if heated
very strongly, copper(II) sulfate decomposes to form black copper(II)
oxide. This can be very difficult to judge if there is no colour change.

Real gases
The ideal gas equation relies on two key assumptions:
• forces between molecules are negligible
• gas molecules have negligible size compared to the size of their container.
These assumptions hold at low pressures and high temperatures when the
gas molecules are far apart and moving fast.
When gas molecules are close together, the volume of the molecules
compared with the volume of the container starts to become significant.
Also if gas molecules move comparatively slowly, they have less energy and
intermolecular forces may become significant.
Scientists have developed several improvements to the ideal gas equation
for real gases. In the real gas equation, corrections have been made to take
into account the volume of gas molecules and intermolecular forces.

Chemists use balanced equations to find:
the quantities of reactants required to prepare a requried quantity
of a product
the quantities of products that should be formed from certain
quantities of reactants.
These quantities can then be changed to adjust the scale of a
preparation.
Quantities from amounts and equations
The two worked examples show how unknown information about a
substance can be obtained using amounts and an equation together.
Each example follows the same basic method:
Study tip
For most problems, steps 1 and 2
will follow the same method. The
processing for step 3 can vary.
• Step 1: Work out the amount in moles of whatever you can.
• Step 2: Use the equation to work out the amount in moles of the
unknown chemical.
. Step 3: Work out the unknown information required.

Calculate the mass of aluminium oxide, Al,0,, formed when
8.10g of aluminium completely reacts with oxygen.
Step 1: Calculate the amount, in moles, of Al that reacts.
8.10 = 0.300 mol
n(Al) = m = 8.100
Study tip
You need the ratios:
4 mol Al 2 mol A1,0
Then halve the moles of Al to get
the moles of AI20,-
0.300 mol Al 0.150 mol A1,0
Step 2: Use the equation to find the amount of Al,0, in moles,
that forms.

3.3 Moles and volumes
Specification reference: 2.1.3
Using volume for measuring amount of substance
Liquids and gases are measured by volume. As with mass, the volume
of a solution or a gas can be converted into amount of substance, in
moles, giving us a way to count the particles present.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of:
→ concentration, solution
volumes, and the mole
► molar gas volumes
► the ideal gas equation.
The volume measurements commonly used in chemistry are:
= 1 ml
the cubic centimetre (cm) or millilitre (ml): 1 cm
• the cubic decimetre (dm) or litre (1):
Idm = 1000 cm = 1000 ml = 1 litre, 1 l.
You will be expected to use cm and dm. In practical work, you will
use glassware graduated in ml and I, and you should record these
readings in cm and dm.
Moles and solutions
To work out the amount, in moles, of a measured volume of the
solution, you need to know the concentration (moldm ) of the
solute (the dissolved compound). The concentration of a solution is
the amount of solute, in moles, dissolved in each 1 dm (1000 cm)
of solution.
A Figure 1 Laboratory glassware
Almol dm-3 solution contains 1 mol of solute dissolved in each
1 dm of solution.
Converting between moles and solution volumes
For a solution, amount n (mol) and volume V (dm) are linked by the
concentration c (moldm?).
Study tip
You will use these equations many
times, so you will need to learn them.
11 =CA
You will usually measure volumes in cm so you will need to convert
into dm' by dividing by 1000. The equation then becomes:
n=cx V (cm)

3.3 Moles and volumes
RTP is about 20°C and 101 kPa (1 atm) pressure
At RTP, 1 mole of gas molecules has a volume of approximately
24.0 dm = 24000 cm.
Therefore, at RTP, the molar gas volume = 24.0 dm’mol-!.
.
Converting between amount in moles and gas volumes
Using the following equation, you can convert between the amount in
moles of a gas, and the volume of the gas, V.

able to rise up to the ozone layer

2 Calculate the volume, in dm?, of 0.150 mol 0,(g) at RTP.

The ideal gas equation
Room temperature and pressure will always be approximate, chosen
to match the typical conditions that experiments are carried out in.
So what do you do when carrying out experiments where the gases
are at different temperatures or pressures, or if you need to be more
accurate? The ideal gas equation provides a solution.
You will have come across the following assumptions for the
molecules making up an ideal gas:
• random motion
elastic collisions
negligible size
no intermolecular forces.
The ideal gas equation is shown below.
PV = nRT
The ideal gas constant R is a pV = nRT constant and always has the
same value of 8.314J mol-'K-1. Temperature is in units of K (Kelvin),
which starts at absolute zero (-273°C). Each 1 K rise in temperature is
the same as a l°C rise in temperature.

Standard solutions
A standard solution is a solution of known concentration,
In practical work, you will have seen bottles of standard solutions
labelled with their concentration, often as I moldm-?.
Standard solutions and their
preparation are discussed in detail
in Topic 4.2, Acid-base titrations.
Standard solutions are prepared by dissolving an exact mass of the
solute in a solvent and making up the solution to an exact volume.
Using your understanding of the mole, you can work out the mass
required to prepare a standard solution.
) Worked example: Standard solutions
Calculate the mass of Na, co, required to prepare 100 cm
0.250 moldm" standard solution.
of a
Step 1: First work out the amount in moles required.
V (in cm) - 0.250 x 100 = 0.0250 mol
n(Na, CO3) = CX1000
Step 2: Then work out the molar mass of Na,Co,.
M(Na CO2) = 23.0 x 2 + 12.0 + 16.0 x 3 = 106.0g mol-1
Step 3: Rearrange nam to calculate the mass of Na Co, required.
m=nx M = 0.0250 x 106.0 = 2.65g
Other ways of showing concentrations
You will often see mass concentrations with units of gdm . For the
solution of Na,Co, in the worked example above, the concentration
is 0.250 moldm-3. To work out the mass concentration, you need to
convert between moles and grams.
• num so, m= n < M = 0.250 x 106.0 = 26.50g
• mass concentration of Na,Co, = 26.5g dm-3.
Moles and gas volumes
In Topic 3.1, you saw how to convert between mass in grams and
amount of substance in moles. It is difficult to measure the mass of a
gas but easy to measure gas volumes.
At the same temperature and pressure, equal volumes of different
gases contain the same number of molecules.
So when you measure a gas volume, you are indirectly counting the
number of gas molecules (or the amount of gas molecules in moles).
Molar volume
The molar gas volume V is the volume per mole of gas molecules at
a stated temperature and pressure.
The volume of a gas depends on the pressure and temperature, but many
experiments are carried out at room temperature and pressure (RTP).
