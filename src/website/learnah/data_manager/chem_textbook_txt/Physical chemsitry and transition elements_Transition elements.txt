Ligand substitution and haemoglobin
Blood carries oxygen around the body due to presence of haemoglobin,
the iron-containing protein present in all red blood cells. Haemoglobin
contains four protein chains held together by weak intermolecular
forces. Each protein chain has a haem molecule within its structure. The
central metal ion in a haem group is Fe2+ which can bind to oxygen gas,
0, (Figure 7).
As blood passes through the lungs, the haemoglobin bonds to oxygen
because of the increased oxygen pressure in the capillaries of the
lungs. A compound called oxyhaemoglobin forms, which releases this
oxygen to body cells as and when required (Figure 8). In addition, the
haemoglobin in red blood cells can bond to carbon dioxide, which is
carried back to the lungs. Carbon dioxide is then released from the red
blood cells and carbon dioxide is exhaled.
Carbon monoxide can also bind to the Fe2+ ion in haemoglobin.
The complex formed is known as carboxyhaemoglobin. If carbon
monoxide is breathed in, a ligand substitution reaction takes place
where the oxygen in haemoglobin is replaced by carbon monoxide.
Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin more strongly than oxygen,
so a small concentration of carbon monoxide in the lungs can prevent
a large proportion of the haemoglobin molecules from carrying
oxygen. The bond is so strong that this process is irreversible. If the
concentration of carboxyhaemoglobin becomes too high, oxygen
transport is prevented, leading to death.
Figure 8 Oxyhaemoglobin in red
blood cells is responsible for carrying
oxygen round the body
Precipitation reactions
A precipitation reaction occurs when two aqueous solutions
containing ions react together to form an insoluble ionic solid, called a
precipitate.
Transition metal ions in aqueous solution react with aqueous sodium
hydroxide and aqueous ammonia to form precipitates. However, some
of these precipitates will dissolve in an excess of sodium hydroxide or
ammonia to form complex ions in solution.

The special case of chromium and copper
In Table I the electron configurations of chromium and copper do not
follow the expected principle for placing electrons singly in orbitals
before pairing. A simplistic explanation is one of stability. It is believed
that a half-filled d sub-shell and a fully filled dio sub-shell give
additional stability to atoms of chromium and copper.
Study tip
When forming ions of d-block
elements, the 4s electrons are
removed before any of the 3d
electrons are removed.
Electron configuration of d-block ions
When the d-block elements, scandium to zinc, form positive ions
from their atoms, they lose their 4s electrons before losing any of the
3d electrons. This means that:
when forming an atom, the 4s orbital fills before the 3d orbitals
when forming an ion, the 4s orbital empties before the 3d orbitals.
The electron configurations of an iron atom and its common ions, Fe2+
and Fest, are shown below.

Fe3+ ion 15²2s22p 3s 3p63d Two 4s and one 3d electron lost
Transition elements
Transition elements are defined as d-block elements that form at
least one ion with a partially filled d-orbital. Although scandium and
zinc are d-block elements, they do not match this definition and are
not classified as transition elements.
Scandium only forms the ion Sc+ by loss of two 4s electrons and one
3d electron
• The electron configuration of Sc is 1s²2s²2p63s 3p 3d'45.
SC3+ has an electronic configuration of 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p6.
401
24
24.1 d-block elements
Zinc only forms the Zn2+ ion by the loss of its two 4s electrons.
• The electron configuration of Zn is 1s22s 2p 3s 3p 3d104s2.
• Zn2+ has an electronic configuration of 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p63d10.
Sc3+ ions have empty d-orbitals and Zn2+ ions have full d-orbitals.
So scandium and zinc do not form ions with partially filled d-orbitals
and are not therefore classified as transition elements.
Study tip
You are expected to be able to list
these properties and give suitable
examples.
Properties of the transition metals and their
compounds
The transition elements have a number of characteristic properties that
are different from other metals.
They form compounds in which the transition element has
different oxidation states.
They form coloured compounds.
The elements and their compounds can act as catalysts.
Variable oxidation states
Transition elements form compounds with more than one oxidation
state. For example, iron forms two chlorides - iron (II) chloride, FeCl,,
and iron(III) chloride, FeCl,
The number of oxidation states increases across the transition
elements series to manganese, and then decreases. All of the
transition elements form compounds with an oxidation number
of +2, resulting from the loss of two electrons. Each oxidation
state often has a characteristic colour. The common oxidation
states of the ions of transition elements are shown in Table 2,
together with their typical colours.

The d-block elements are all metallic, displaying the typical physical
properties of metals. They have high melting points and boiling points,
are shiny in appearance, and conduct both electricity and heat. Their
metallic properties give rise to some of their uses.
Elements such as copper, silver, nickel, and zinc have been used in
coinage for many years - iron is used extensively in construction and
the production of tools, and copper for electrical cables and water pipes.
Titanium is known for its great strength and is used in the aerospace
industry as well as in medical applications such as joint replacement
and in cosmetic dentistry. Figure 2 shows some of the common uses of

Figure 3 The addition of

Ligand substitution with chloride ions
Concentrated hydrochloric acid, HCl, can be used as a source of
chloride ions. When an excess of concentrated hydrochloric acid is
added to a solution containing [Cu(H20)]2+, the pale blue solution
changes colour to form a yellow solution. This is another example of
a ligand substitution reaction as six water ligands have been replaced
with four chloride ligands.
If water is added to the yellow solution, a blue solution will be formed,
although more dilute and paler in colour than the original blue solution.
If you take care making your observations, you will notice that an
intermediate green solution is formed. This is not a new species but is
the result of the yellow solution mixing with the blue solution to give
a green colour as the reaction proceeds (Figure 3).
The equation below shows that the reaction is in equilibrium.

In this reaction, you will notice a change in coordination number, a
change in colour, and a change in shape. However, the oxidation state
of the copper remains as +2. Chloride ligands are larger in size than
the water ligands, so fewer chloride ligands can fit round the central
Cu2+ ion. This explains the change in coordination number (Figure 4).
Reactions of aqueous chromium(III) ions
When chromium(III) potassium sulfate, KCr(SO2), 12(H,O),
also known as chrome alum, is dissolved in water, the complex
ion [Cr(H,O).]3+ is formed. This is a pale purple solution. When
chromium(III) sulfate is dissolved in water, a green solution containing
chromium(III) is formed. However, this solution is not [Cr(H,O) 15+,
rather it is the complex ion [Cr(H,O) S0,1t, where one of the water
ligands has been replaced by the sulfate ion, SO -. Both the purple
and green solutions, contain chromium(III) ions in oxidation state +3.

In the reaction, four ammonia ligands have replaced four of the water
ligands. Both [Cu(H20),12+ (aq) and [Cu(NH3)4(H20),]2+(aq) are
octahedral complex ions.
The chemistry of this reaction is a little more complex than it first seems.
When carrying out qualitative analysis, you should always add the
reagent (ammonia) drop-wise to the solution under test (in this case,
the [Cu(H2O),12+(aq) solution) so that all observations are recorded.
If you are careful you will see two different reactions taking place:
• A pale blue precipitate of Cu(OH), is formed in the first stage of
the reaction.
The Cu(OH), precipitate then dissolves in excess ammonia to form
a dark blue solution.

Formation of coloured compounds
Compounds and ions of transition elements are frequently coloured.
Potassium dichromate(VI) is bright orange, cobalt(II) chloride is
pink-purple, nickel(II) sulfate is green, whilst hydrated copper(II)
sulfate is blue. The solid compounds can be dissolved in water to
produce coloured solutions.
The colour of a solution is linked to the partially filled d-orbitals of the
transition metal ion. The colour of a solution can vary with different
oxidation states.
For example, iron forms two common oxidation states, +2 and +3, in
its compounds. The oxidation states form different coloured solutions:
Iron (II) Fe2+ 1s22s22p 3s 3p%3d - pale green
Iron(III) Fe3+ 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 3d - yellow
Chromium forms two common oxidation states, +3 and +6 in its

24.3 Stereoisomerism in

Stereoisomers
Stereoisomers have the same structural formula but a different
arrangement of the atoms in space. Complex ions can display two
types of stereoisomerism:

treatment of cancer.
cis-trans isomerism
optical isomerism.
Stereoisomerism is also very important for organic chemistry.
For complex ions, the type of stereoisomerism depends on the number
and type of ligands that are attached to the central metal ion, and the
shape of the complex.
Some four-coordinate and six-coordinate complex ions containing
two different monodentate ligands show cis-trans isomerism.
Some six-coordinate complex ions containing monodentate and
bidentate ligands can show both cis-trans and optical isomerism.
Synoptic link
In Topic 13.2, Stereoisomerism,
you met cis-trans and E/Z
stereoisomerism in alkenes. You
will meet optical isomerism in
organic chemistry in Topic 27.2,
Amino acids, amides, and chirality.
Cis-trans isomerism in complex ions
In organic chemistry, cis-trans stereoisomerism requires the presence
of a C=C double bond which prevents rotation of groups attached to
each carbon atom of the C=C bond.
In complex ions, no double bond is involved and the shape of the
complex holds groups in different orientations about the central
metal ion.
Cis-trans isomerism occurs in some square planar and octahedral
complex ions.
Cis-trans isomerism in square planar complexes
The simplest example of cis-trans isomerism is found in four coordinate
square planar complexes that have no more than two identical ligands
attached to the central metal ion. The complex [Pd(NH),Cl2], formed
from the Pd2+ ion, two NH, ligands and two Cl- ligands, shows cis-trans
isomerism (Figure 1).
In square planar complexes the ligands are arranged in the same plane
at the corners of a square with 90° bond angles. In the cis-isomer,
the two identical groups are adjacent to each other, whereas in the
trans-isomer the two identical groups are opposite each other. In the
cis-isomer the coordinate bonds between the identical ligands are 90°
apart. In the trans-isomer the coordinate bonds between the identical
ligands are 180° apart.

The catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide forming oxygen
uses manganese (IV) oxide, MnO,(s), as the catalyst:
24,02(aq) → 2H2O(l) + O2(g)
These are all examples of heterogeneous catalysis, as the catalyst is
in a different state to the reactants. However, some chemical reactions
are catalysed by homogeneous catalysts where the catalyst is in
the same physical state as the reactants. For example, the reaction
between iodide ions and peroxodisulfate ions, S,0,2-, is catalysed by
Fe2+(aq) ions, with reactants and catalyst all in aqueous solution. The
overall reaction is shown below.
,0,-(aq) + 21- (aq) → 250,- (aq) + 1(aq)
When the reaction is carried out with a trace of starch, a blue-black
colour forms showing the formation of iodine. If this experiment
is repeated, with a small amount of Fe2+(aq) added, the blue-black
solution forms much more quickly demonstrating the catalytic action
of the transition metal ion. The equations below show how Fe2+(aq)
ions catalyse the reaction:
Fe2+ (aq) reacts 3,0,2-(aq) + Fe2+ (aq) + 250,- (aq) + Fe3+(aq)
Fe2+ (aq) regenerated Fe3+ (aq) + 21- (aq) → 12(aq) + Fe2+ (aq)
So although Fe2+ is used up in the first step, it is regenerated in the
second step. Overall Fe2+ ions are not consumed.
The reaction of zinc metal with acids is catalysed by the presence of
Cu2+(aq) ions, for example:
Zn(s) + H2SO4(aq) → ZnSO4(aq) + H2(g)

How does cis-platin work?

Ligands usually contain a lone pair
of electrons.
Common ligands in transition metal chemistry
A ligand is any molecule or ion that can donate a pair of electrons to
a central metal ion. Some ligands like water are neutral and have no
charge, whereas other ligands like the hydroxide ion are negatively
charged
Monodentate ligands
A ligand that is able to donate one pair of electrons to a central metal
ion is called a monodentate ligand. Some monodentate ligands are
shown in Table 1.

Bidentate ligands
Some ligands can donate two lone pairs of electrons to the central
metal ion, forming two coordinate bonds. These ligands are called
bidentate ligands. The most common bidentate ligands are
1,2-diaminoethane (frequently shortened to en) and the ethanedioate
(oxalate) ion. Figure 3 shows these ligands and lone pairs that may be
able to bond to the central metal ion.

If you are given an unfamiliar
ligand, it is important that you
show how the ligands bond to the

lone pair of electrons to the central metal ion.
An example of a complex ion containing a bidentate ligand is
[CO(NH,CH,CHNH_)31+ (Figure 4).
In this complex:
the oxidation number of Co is +3

24.2 The formation and shapes of
complex ions
Specification reference: 5.3.1
Complex ions
One of the most important properties of the d-block elements is their
ability to form complex ions. When solid hydrated copper(II) sulfate,
CuS0, 51,0, is dissolved in water, a blue solution forms containing
the complex ion [Cu(H2O),12+ (Figure 1). Complex ions are not
restricted to d-block elements - other elements such as aluminium can
also form complex ions.

The formation of complex ions
A complex ion is formed when one or more molecules or negatively
charged ions bond to a central metal ion. These molecules or ions are
known as ligands.
A ligand is defined as a molecule or ion that donates a pair of
electrons to a central metal ion to form a coordinate bond or
dative covalent bond.
A dative covalent bond or coordinate bond, a special kind of
covalent bond, is formed when one of the bonded atoms provides
both of the electrons for the shared pair.
The coordination number indicates the number of coordinate
bonds attached to the central metal ion.
Representing complexions
In its formula, the complex ion is enclosed inside square brackets
with the overall charge of the complex shown outside of the square
brackets. The overall charge on a complex ion is the sum of the
charges on the central metal ion and any ligands present.

CuSO, 5H20, dissolves in water to form
a blue solution containing [Cu(H20)]2+
complex ions
An example of a complex ion is [Cr(H2O),]+, formed when
CrCl,H,O is dissolved in water. Cr3+ is the central metal ion - water
acts as a ligand with each water molecule donating a lone pair of
electrons from the oxygen atom to the central metal ion to form
a coordinate bond. The coordination number is 6 as there are six
coordinate bonds to the central metal ion (Figure 2).

Optical isomerism in octahedral complexes
Optical isomerism only occurs in octahedral complexes containing two

non-superimposable mirror images of each other, like a left hand and
a right hand.
The cis isomer with formula [Co(NH,CH,CH,NH,),C1,]+ shown in
Figure 6 also exists as two optical isomers. Trans-isomers cannot form
optical isomers as a mirror image is exactly the same and can be

angles around the manganese of 90° (Figure 5). The complex ion

Colours in transition metal chemistry
In general, the colour of a complex ion depends upon the
metal at the centre of the complex, its oxidation state, and
the ligands that are coordinately bonded to the central
metal ion. For a compound to have colour it must absorb
visible light. The visible spectrum is shown in Figure 8.
When a compound absorbs visible light, the colour seen is
the sum of the remaining colours that are not absorbed. If
a compound absorbs all wavelengths of visible light, the
compound will appear black. If a compound absorbs the
wavelengths of every colour except blue, the compound
will appear blue.
If magenta is absorbed by a sample then the colour
observed is green, on the opposite side of the colour chart
(Figure 9). Similarly if the wavelengths of blue and red
light are absorbed, the compound will appear green.

TRANSITION ELEMENTS
Cu(OH),(s) is a blue precipitate which dissolves in excess ammonia to
form a deep blue solution with the formula, [Cu(NH,) (H,O),]2+ (aq).
You will find these colour changes in Figure 1.
For chromium the precipitation reaction is shown below:
Cr3+ (aq) + 3OH- (aq) → Cr(OH)3(s)
Cr(OH), is a green precipitate which dissolves in excess ammonia to
form [Cr(NHz)]3+ (aq) which is a purple solution. You will find these
colour changes in Figure 6.
Fe2+, Fe3+, and Mn2+ react with an excess of aqueous ammonia in
the same way as they react with aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming
precipitates of Fe(OH),(s), Fe(OH),(s), and Mn(OH),(s). There is no
further reaction with aqueous ammonia and so these precipitates do
not dissolve.
