2 Attach the capillary tube containing the sample to a thermometer
using a rubber band.
Insert the thermometer through a hole in the cork if using a Thiele
tube or clamp the thermometer if using an oil bath. The end of the
thermometer and the end of the capillary tube should dip into the
oil (Figure 9).
Using a micro-burner, slowly heat the side arm of the Thiele tube
or the oil bath whilst observing the solid. When the solid starts
to melt, remove the heat and record the temperature at which
all of the solid has melted. It is important to heat the oil slowly
when approaching the melting point, and it is advisable to repeat
the melting point determination a second time to ensure that you
obtain an accurate value.

Carbon-carbon bond formation in synthesis
Reactions that form carbon-carbon bonds have a central importance
to organic chemistry as they provide a means of synthesising new
compounds containing more carbon atoms. In this topic you will be
looking at reactions that can be used to lengthen a carbon chain, to
add a side chain to a benzene ring and to introduce new functional
groups which can then be reacted further.
Formation of nitriles
The nitrile group is the organic functional group -CN.
Nitriles from haloalkanes
Nitriles can be formed by reacting haloalkanes with sodium cyanide,
NaCN, or potassium cyanide, KCN, in ethanol. In this reaction the
length of the carbon chain is increased.

attacked, the 2-hydroxy-2-phenylethanenitrile
is released from a storage chamber into a
reaction chamber where it mixes with an
enzyme. The reaction between the enzyme and
the hydroxynitrile releases very toxic hydrogen
cyanide, together with benzaldehyde
(Figure 3). The millipede secretes this toxic
mixture from glands located in its body

Forming carbon-carbon bonds to benzene rings
In Topic 25.2, Electrophilic
substitution reactions of benzene,
you have already met alkylation
and acylation as methods for
increasing the number of carbon
atoms in an aromatic compound.
Alkylation
Alkylation is a reaction that transfers an alkyl group from a haloalkane
to a benzene ring. The reaction takes place in the presence of a

Organometallic compounds in carbon-carbon
bond formation
Compounds that contain a carbon-metal bond are known as organometallic
compounds. Organometallic compounds are very important for forming
carbon-carbon bonds in organic compounds to increase the length of a
carbon chain. Organometallic compounds containing magnesium or lithium
are often used for this purpose.
• An organometallic compound provides a source of a nucleophile called a
carbanion, which contain a carbon atom with a negative charge.
The carbanion reacts with a positively charged or + carbon atom to form
a new carbon-carbon bond.
Grignard reagents
Organometallic compounds called Grignard reagents are made by reacting
magnesium with an alkyl or aryl haloalkane dissolved in an ether solvent

28.2 Further practical techniques
Melting point determination
Chemists determine the melting point of solids to identify whether a
solid compound is pure. A pure organic substance usually has a very
sharp melting range of one or two degrees. The melting range is the
difference between the temperature at which the sample starts to melt
and the temperature at which melting is complete. If the compound
contains impurities, the solid melts over a wide range of temperatures.
An impure sample also has a lower melting point than a pure sample.
A Figure 4 Closing the end of a
capillary tube by heating in a Bunsen
burner. The tube is rotated quickly in the
hot Bunsen flame to seal one end of the
tube. Only the edge of the flame is used
so that only the tip of the capillary tube
is heated. Otherwise the tube might bend
as this tube has started to do
1 Before taking the melting point of a solid you should ensure that
the sample is completely dry and free flowing.
2 Take a glass capillary tube or melting point tube. Hold one end of
the capillary tube in the hot flame of a Bunsen burner. Rotate the
tube in the flame until the end of the tube is sealed (Figure 4).
The capillary tube is allowed to cool, and is then filled with crystals
to about 3 mm depth. This is usually carried out by pushing the
open end of the capillary into the solid sample to force some of the
solid into the tube (Figure 5).
4 Once you have prepared your sample you will need to take its
melting point. In schools and colleges, one of two methods will be
available depending on the apparatus available.
Using electrically heated melting point apparatus
1 Place the capillary tube containing the sample into a sample hole
and a 0-300°C thermometer in the thermometer hole of the
melting point apparatus (Figure 7).
Using the rapid heating setting, start to heat up the sample whilst
observing the sample through the magnifying window.
A Figure 5 The sample is forced up the
capillary tube by dipping the open end of
the tube into the sample
Figure 7 Electrically operated melting point apparatus
Once the solid is seen to melt, record the melting point. Allow the
melting point apparatus to cool.
Prepare a second sample in a new capillary tube and place in the
melting point apparatus and again heat up the sample.
As the melting point is approached, set to low and raise the
temperature slowly whilst observing the sample. An accurate
determination of the melting point can then be obtained.

Preparing, purifying, and determining the melting point an organic
solid are important practical skills. You have already seen how to use
Quickfit apparatus for distilling and heating under reflux.

Preparation of an organic solid
There are a number of experiments that you may carry out to prepare
an organic solid. In the preparation of aspirin, you reflux salicylic
acid, ethanoic anhydride, and glacial ethanoic acid using Quickfit
apparatus. When preparing benzoic acid by alkaline hydrolysis, you
use Quickfit apparatus to reflux methyl benzoate with aqueous
sodium hydroxide, followed by acidification. In both preparations
a solid forms which has to be separated from the reaction mixture
before it can be purified.
Synoptic link
Distillation and heating under
reflux were covered in Topic 16.1,
Practical techniques in organic
chemistry.
Filtration under reduced pressure
Filtration under reduced pressure is a technique for separating a solid
product from a solvent or liquid reaction mixture. You will need the
following apparatus to carry out this technique:
Buchner flask
Buchner funnel
pressure tubing
filter paper
access to filter or vacuum pump.
Connect one end of the pressure tubing to the vacuum outlet or to
the filter pump whilst attaching the other end of the rubber tubing
to the Buchner flask.
Fit the Buchner funnel to the Buchner flask ensuring that there is
a good tight fit. This is usually obtained using a Buchner ring or a
rubber bung (Figure 1).
3 Switch on the vacuum pump, or the tap, to which your filter
pump is attached.
4 Check for good suction by placing your hand across the top of the
funnel.
Place a piece of filter paper inside the Buchner funnel and wet this
with the same solvent used in preparing your solid. You should see
the paper being sucked down against the holes in the funnel.
To filter your sample, slowly pour the reaction mixture from a
beaker into the centre of the filter paper.
Rinse out the beaker with the solvent so that all of the solid
crystals collect in the Buchner funnel.
8 Rinse the crystals in the Buchner funnel with more solvent and
leave them under suction for a few minutes so that the crystals
start to dry.

Study tip
You need to be able to suggest
reagents, conditions, and
equations for converting one
compound into another in
multi-stage syntheses.

Organic synthesis
The term target molecule is used to indicate the molecule that you
are trying to obtain. In order to devise an organic synthesis you will
need to identify the functional groups in the target molecule and in
the starting material. You then select a sequence of steps to convert
the starting material into the target molecule. Sometimes it is easier to
work backwards from the target molecule.
Worked example: Synthesis of ethanamide
Devise a flow chart to show how a sample of ethanamide could
be prepared starting from chloroethane. Show the reagents you
would use to carry out each step in your flow chart.
Stage 1: Identify the functional groups in the starting and target
molecules.

Study tip
Both molecules contain the same
number of carbon atoms. The
synthesis will involve changing
functional groups only.

Stage 2: Identify a sequence of chemical reactions that could
convert the functional groups in the starting molecule
into the functional groups of the target molecule
Primary amides can be prepared from acyl chlorides.
• Acyl chlorides can be made from carboxylic acids.
• An alcohol can be oxidised to a carboxylic acid.
