Optical isomers are drawn to show the 3D tetrahedral arrangement of
the four different groups around the central chiral carbon atom. Once
one isomer has been drawn, the other isomer is drawn as a mirror
image, reflecting the first structure. The two optical isomers of

Optical isomerism - testing our senses
Our senses of taste and smell are regulated by
chiral molecules, which interact with receptor sites
in our mouths and noses. Optical isomers interact
differently with our receptors, inducing different
taste and smell sensations. The two optical isomers
of the amino acid leucine, (CH),CHCHCH,CH(NH)
COOH, have different tastes, one being bitter
whereas the other one is sweet. The bitter isomer is
used as a food additive.

Amino acids, like carboxylic acids, are easily esterified by heating with
an alcohol in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid.
In Figure 4, the d-amino acid serine is reacted with excess ethanol and

Zwitterions have no overall charge because the positive and negative charges
cancel out. The isoelectric point is the pH at which the zwitterion is formed,
and each amino acid has its own unique isoelectric point.
If an amino acid is added to a solution with a pH greater than its isoelectric point,
the amino acid behaves as an acid and loses a proton (Figure 6).
Ifan amino acid is added to a solution with a pH lower than its isoelectric point,

Amides are the products of reactions of acyl chlorides with ammonia
and amines. Amide groups are common in nature. For example, in
proteins the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids are
bonded together to form amide groups.
As with amines, there are primary, secondary, and tertiary amides

See Topic 13.2, Stereoisomerism,
for an introduction to
stereoisomerism and E/Z
isomerism.
Stereoisomerism
You should recall that stereoisomers are compounds with the same
structural formula but a different arrangement of atoms. Another type
of stereoisomerism is optical isomerism.
Optical isomerism
Optical isomerism is found in molecules that contain a chiral centre.
In organic chemistry, the chiral centre is a carbon atom that is attached
to four different atoms or groups of atoms.
Synoptic link
You have come across
optical isomers in transition
elements covered in Topic 24.3,
Stereoisomerism in complex ions.
The presence of a chiral carbon atom in a molecule leads to the
existence of two non-superimposable mirror image structures. These
two molecules are known as optical isomers or enantiomers. For
each chiral carbon atom, there is always one pair of optical isomers.
Chirality in C-amino acids
Chiral carbon atoms exist widely in naturally occurring organic
molecules. For example, all sugars, proteins, and nucleic acids contain
chiral carbon atoms.
COOH
COOH
CH
With the exception of glycine, H,NCH,COOH, all
C.-amino acids, RCH(NH,)COOH, contain a chiral

different atoms or groups. In the structure, the chiral
carbon atom is shown labelled with an asterisk *.

Chirality is not just reserved for carbon atoms and the term applies
to any centre that holds attachments that can be arranged as two
non-superimposable mirror image forms. Like a pair of hands, optical
isomers can be considered as right- and left-handed forms and one
optical isomer cannot be superimposed upon the other.

amino acid and a pair of hands - both
examples of chirality

Amino acids
An amino acid is an organic compound containing both amine, NH,,
and carboxylic acid, COOH, functional groups. The body has 20 common
amino acids that can be built into proteins. These amino acids are all
C.-amino acids in which the amine group is attached to the C-carbon
atom - the second carbon atom, next to the carboxyl group. These 20
amino acids differ by the side chain, R, attached to the same a-carbon
atom. The structure of an c-amino acid is shown in Figure 1.
The general formula of an a-amino acid can be written as
RCH(NH,)COOH. There are also less common amino acids in which
the amine group is connected to the B-carbon atom (the third carbon)
and the y-carbon atom (the fourth carbon).
Since amino acids have both an acidic COOH and a basic NH,
functional group, amino acids have similar reactions to both carboxylic
acids and amines.

Reactions of the amine group
The amine group is basic and reacts with acids to make salts. As such,
amino acids will also react with acids to form salts. The amino acid
alanine (2-aminopropanoic acid) reacts with hydrochloric acid to
form an ammonium salt (Figure 2).

For this type of a polyester formation, two different monomers are
involved, each with different functional groups.

One monomer is a dicarboxylic acid, with two carboxyl groups.
Terylene is a condensation polymer made from the reaction between
the two monomers, benzene-1,4-carboxylic acid, HOOCCH COOH,
and ethane-1,2-diol, HO(CH), OH. The formation of Terylene from
its monomers is shown in Figure 4. During the condensation reaction
a hydroxyl group on the diol reacts with a carboxyl group on the
dicarboxylic acid forming an ester linkage and water,

Polyamides are condensation polymers formed when monomers are
joined together by amide linkages in a long chain to form the polymer.

group - or from two monomers, one containing two carboxylic acid
groups (or acyl chlorides) and the other containing two amine groups.

Polyesters and polyamides
Alkenes can form polymers by addition polymerisation. In this
topic, you will look at a different type of polymerisation called
condensation polymerisation.
Polyesters and polyamides are two important condensation polymers
made on an industrial scale. Carboxylic acids and their derivatives are
common starting materials for their preparation.

Condensation polymerisation is the joining of monomers with loss

Polyesters
When making a polyester, monomers are joined together by ester
linkages in a long chain to form the polymer. Polyesters can be made
from one monomer containing both a carboxylic acid and an alcohol
group, or from two monomers - one containing two carboxylic acid
groups and the other containing two alcohol groups.
Synoptic link
You covered addition

Polymerisation in alkenes.
Polyesters made from one monomer containing two different
functional groups
For this type of a polyester formation, only one monomer is involved,
containing both different functional groups, a hydroxyl group, -OH,
and a carboxyl group, -COOH.
Poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) is the simplest polyester of this type, made by
condensation polymerisation of its monomer, glycolic acid, HOCH,COOH.
Glycolic acid contains both a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group.
Study tip
You do not need to learn any
specific examples of condensation
polymerisation, but you do need to
understand the principles of how
the polymers are formed.

27.1 Amines
Specification reference: 6.2.1
What are amines?
Amines are organic compounds, derived from ammonia, NH,, in
which one or more hydrogen atoms in ammonia have been replaced
by a carbon chain or ring.
Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge,
understanding, and application of: :
→ amines as bases
→ preparation of amines
→ reactions of amines.
In an aliphatic amine, the nitrogen atom is attached to at
least one straight or branched carbon chain (alkyl group, R).
Methylamine, CH NH,, is the simplest aliphatic amine with one
methyl group attached to the nitrogen atom.
In an aromatic amine, the nitrogen atom is attached to an
aromatic ring (aryl group, Ar). Phenylamine, C H NH, is the
simplest aromatic amine, with a phenyl C H group attached to the
nitrogen atom.
Study tip
When drawing the structure of
an amine, you should show the
lone pair.
Classifying amines
Amines are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary by the number
of alkyl or aryl groups attached to the nitrogen atom (Table 1).

27.1 Amines
Salt formation
Amines are bases and they neutralise acids to make salts. For
example, propylamine reacts with hydrochloric acid to form the salt
propylammonium chloride.
Study tip
The neutralisation of acids
by amines is similar to the
neutralisation of acids by ammonia:
NH2 + HCI - NH, C1

Preparation of aliphatic amines
Formation of primary amines
Ammonia has a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom which
allows ammonia to act as a nucleophile in a substitution reaction
with a haloalkane. The product of this reaction is an ammonium salt.
Aqueous alkali is then added to generate the amine from the salt.
See Topic 15.1, The chemistry
of haloalkanes, for details of
nucleophilic substitution reactions
of haloalkanes.
The equations below show the formation of propylamine from
1-chloropropane and ammonia. Propylamine is a primary amine
because there is one carbon atom attached to the nitrogen atom of the
amine group.
salt formation:
CH,CH,CH, CI + NH, CH,CH,CH,NH,Cl-
1-chloropropane propylammonium chloride (salt)
amine formation:
CH,CH,CH,NH, C1+ NaOH → CH,CH,CH,NH, + NaCl + H,O
propylammonium chloride
propylamine
For this reaction to occur, there are some essential conditions.
• Ethanol is used as the solvent. This prevents any substitution of
the haloalkane by water to produce alcohols.
Excess ammonia is used. This reduces further substitution of the
amine group to form secondary and tertiary amines (see below).
Formation of secondary and tertiary amines
The reaction above is unsuitable for making a pure primary amine. The
product still contains a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom that
can react further with a haloalkane to form a secondary amine. The
product of this reaction is again an ammonium salt.
CH,CH,CH,Cl + CH,CH,CH,NH, (CH,CH,CH,),NH,+CH
propylamine dipropylammonium chloride (salt)
The secondary amine is obtained from the salt by reacting the product
with sodium hydroxide.
(CH,CH,CH), NH,+C1- + NaOH (CH,CH,CH), NH + NaCl + H,O
dipropylammonium chloride dipropylamine
Tertiary amines can also be formed by further reaction of the
secondary amine. In this example, further substitution would form
tripropylamine, (CH_CH_CH_)N.

Naming amines
There are many different ways of naming the amines. One way to
name a primary amine, with the -NH, group on the end of the chain,
is by adding the suffix -amine to the name of the alkyl chain (Figure 3).

Where a primary amine contains an amine group on any other carbon
but carbon-1, the amine is named using the prefix amino- and a
number is added to indicate the position of the amine group along that
chain (Figure 4).

In secondary or tertiary amines, containing the same alkyl group,
the prefixes di- or tri- are used to indicate the number of alkyl
groups attached to the nitrogen atom, for example, (CH3)2NH is
dimethylamine.

When two or more different groups are attached to a nitrogen atom,
the compound is named as a N-substituted derivative of the larger
group, for example, CH NHCH,CH,CH, is N-methylpropylamine and
CH,N(CH2CH3)CH,CH,CH, is N-ethyl-N-methylpropylamine.

The chemistry of decay
The smell of a decomposing organism, for example, rotting fish, is made
up of all sorts of compounds, but amines and compounds of sulfur give
the characteristic smell of decay. Most of the amines come from the
breakdown of proteins, and two of the amines have such unpleasant
odours that they have been named putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane),
after the process of putrefaction, and cadaverine (1,5-diaminopentane),
after the Latin-derived word for a corpse - cadaver.
Putrescine and cadaverine are also components of bad breath.
Putrescine also has an industrial use - it is a raw material for producing
some condensation polymers.
Draw the skeletal formulae of putrescine and cadaverine.

Reactions of amines
Amines as bases
Amines behave as bases in their chemical reactions as the lone pair of
electrons on the nitrogen atom can accept a proton.
When an amine accepts a proton, a dative covalent bond is formed
between the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom and the
proton (Figure 6).

covalent bonds in Topic 5.3,
