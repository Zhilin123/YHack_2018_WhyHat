The flask is clamped by its neck and the still head is connected to the
flask. The still-head adaptor is T shaped and has two ground-glass
joints, one to fit the screw-cap adaptor and one to fit the condenser.
You should grease the joints so that the apparatus comes apart easily
after the experiment.

A second clamp is placed round the receiver adaptor at the point at
which it is attached to the condenser. This removes the need to clamp
the condenser, as it will be supported sufficiently at both ends.

As with reflux, rubber tubing is used to connect the inlet of the
condenser to the tap and the outlet to the sink. Water always enters
the condenser at the lowest point. For distillation, this is the closest
point to the receiver adaptor.
A flask is used to collect the distillate so that the distillation apparatus
is not completely airtight.
A Figure 5 Apparatus set-up for
distillation
Once the apparatus is set up, the flask is heated and the mixture in the
flask will start to boil. The different liquids in the mixture will have
different boiling points. The liquid with the lowest boiling point is the
most volatile and will boil first.
The vapour moves out of the flask up into the other parts of
the apparatus, leaving behind the less volatile components of
the mixture. When the vapours reach the cold condenser, they
condense and become a liquid. This liquid then drips into the
collecting flask.
Purifying organic products
When preparing samples of organic liquids water may be obtained
along with the product. If this has happened you will see two liquid
layers inside your collection flask, one the organic layer and one the
aqueous or water layer. It is easy to separate these two layers although
it is important that you know which is the organic layer so that you
don't throw away your product by mistake. An easy way to identify
the organic layer is to add some water to your mixture. The layer that
gets bigger is the aqueous layer.

Once the organic layer, has been identified, the two layers are
separated using a separating funnel.

Ensure that the tap of the separating funnel is closed.
Pour the mixture of liquids into the separating funnel, place a
stopper in the top of the funnel, and invert to mix the contents.
Allow the layers to settle.
Add some water to see which layer increase in volume - this is the
aqueous layer.
Place a conical flask under the separating funnel, remove the
stopper and open the tap until the whole of the lower layer has
left the funnel.

ORGANIC SYNTHESIS
In Figure 2, the flask is clamped by its neck. Before fitting the
condenser you need to add the reaction mixture and anti-bumping
granules to the flask. Anti-bumping granules (Figure 3) are added
to the liquid before the flask is heated so that the contents will
boil smoothly. If the granules are not used, large bubbles form
at the bottom of the liquid and make the glassware vibrate or
jump violently.

Finally, apply a thin layer of grease to the ground-glass joint on the
condenser (Figure 4). Place the condenser carefully into the flask and
gently rotate the condenser back and forth to provide a good seal
and ensure that the apparatus comes apart easily at the end of the
experiment.

shaped
flask
During reflux the condenser is kept in the upright position.
Condensers should be clamped only loosely as the glass outer jacket is
very fragile and is easily broken. Never put a stopper in the top of the
condenser. Otherwise you would have a closed system and pressure
would build up inside as the heated air expanded. This could result in
the apparatus exploding!
A Figure 2 Heating under reflux with a
Bunsen burner
Rubber tubing is used to connect the inlet of the condenser to the tap
and the outlet to the sink. Water always enters the condenser at the
bottom and leaves at the top to ensure that the outer jacket is full.
Heating under reflux enables a liquid to be continually boiled
whilst the reaction takes place. This prevents volatile components
from escaping and the flask from boiling dry. The vapour from the
mixture rises up the inner tube of the condenser until it meets the
outer jacket containing cold water. The vapour then condenses and
drips back into the flask. The process is similar to putting a lid on a
saucepan when cooking.
Distillation
Chemical reactions may not go to completion or may produce by-
products as well as the desired product. Once reflux is complete, the
crude liquid or solid product present in the flask needs to be purified
to remove any by-products and remaining reactants. Distillation is a
common method used to separate a pure liquid from its impurities.

used when heating liquids to ensure that
the liquid boils smoothly

Heating under reflux
Many organic reactions occur slowly at room temperature. It is
common for organic reactions to be heated to overcome the activation
energy and increase the rate of reaction. Heating under reflux is a
common procedure used to prepare an organic liquid without boiling
off the solvent, reactants, or products. To heat under reflux, you will
need the following pieces of apparatus:
round-bottom or pear-shaped flask
condenser
rubber tubing
stand and clamp
heat source (usually a Bunsen burner, tripod, and gauze, or a
heating mantle).
Figure 2 shows the experimental setup for a reflux experiment using
a Bunsen burner to heat the reaction mixture. This allows a reaction
under reflux to be carried out at a fixed temperature. A water bath can
be used if the reaction can be carried out below 100°C.
For heating flammable liquids, a heating mantle can be used so that
there is no naked flame present. This provides an added level of safety
should any of the apparatus leak or crack.

Organic synthesis
Organic synthesis is the preparation of complex molecules from
simple starting materials. With organic synthesis, chemists can make
entirely new structures that can be investigated for their uses. The
manufacture of modern medicines targeted at diseases owes much to
the work of organic chemists. Many chemists are employed by large
pharmaceutical companies to synthesise and test new medicines, for
example, those designed to target the growth of cancer cells in the
human body.

6 Place a second conical flask under the separating funnel to collect

7 You will now have one conical flask containing the organic layer
and another containing the aqueous layer. Label the flasks so that
you don't muddle them.
In preparation using acids, your impure product may contain acid
impurities. These can be removed by adding aqueous sodium
carbonate and shaking the mixture in the separating funnel.
Any acid present will react with sodium carbonate releasing carbon
dioxide gas. The tap needs to be slowly opened, holding the stoppered
separating funnel upside down, to release any gas pressure that may
build up.
Finally the aqueous sodium carbonate layer is removed and the
organic layer washed with water before running both layers off into
two separate flasks.

The term target molecule is used to describe the compound that
the chemist is attempting to prepare by organic synthesis.
In a simple synthesis, the target molecule can be obtained by reacting
a readily available starting material with a readily available reagent
in a one-step reaction. However, in most cases synthesis is not that
straightforward. Some organic syntheses require many steps to change
functional groups or to add carbon atoms to the chain length in order
to obtain the target molecule.

Does nature really provide a cure for everything?
Some people believe that the natural resources of our planet provide cures
for every disease or illness, and only time and the limits of our knowledge
prevent us from finding a cure for every illness. You may already know that
the bark of the willow tree had been used for centuries for the treatment of
fever and pain. Salicylic acid was found to be the active component in willow
bark, from which aspirin was developed. As far back as 400 BC willow leaf
tea was used to relieve the pain of childbirth.
Just 50 years ago, paclitaxel was obtained from the bark of the Pacific yew tree
(Figure 5). Taxol is currently used as an anti-cancer drug, specifically for the
treatment of ovarian, breast, and colon cancer. Demand for Taxol is much higher
than the small amounts that can be obtained from yew bark. To meet this
demand, chemists synthesise Taxol from more readily available substances.
About 45 years ago, ibuprofen was introduced in the UK as an anti-inflamatory
drug. Its structure has some similarities to the structure of aspirin. Ibuprofen
is also marketed under several other names such as Nurofen.
