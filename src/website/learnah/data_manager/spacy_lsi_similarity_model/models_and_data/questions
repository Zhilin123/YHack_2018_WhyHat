Write your answers in the spaces provided. SECTION C Swimming Pool Chemistry The circulation of water in swimming pools is much slower than that in most natural water courses, but the number of people using a given volume of water is often far greater. If steps are not taken to keep microorganisms and other contaminants under control, the water will become hazardous. Filters are used to remove solid material and chemicals are added to disinfect the water. The most common method of disinfection involves the use of chlorine compounds, but systems using bromine have advantages. These systems depend on their oxidizing properties. With chlorine systems, the key species is the chlorate(I) ion (OCl) which kills bacteria by damaging the structure of their cell walls and disrupting enzyme activity. A simple way of adding chlorate(I) ions to water is by using chlorine. The weak acid, chloric(I) acid (HOCl), is formed and this dissociates producing the chlorate(I) ion. (a) The equation for the reaction of chlorine with water is: Cl2(aq) + H2O(l) (cid:85) HOCl(aq) + HCl(aq) By referring to the relevant oxidation numbers, explain why this is a disproportionation reaction.

Bond angle =(2) (5)*P44881A01924* 19 Turn over<br />  (c) If the concentration of chlorate(I) ions in a swimming pool is too low, bacteria will flourish. If it is too high, swimmers will be harmed. In the United Kingdom, it is recommended that the concentration of chlorine be in the range 12 mg dm3. The total amount of chlorine, Cl2, present can be measured by titration. In such a determination, excess sulfuric acid and potassium iodide were added to a 1.00 dm3 sample of swimming pool water and the resulting solution required 9.65 cm3 of 0.00550 mol dm3 sodium thiosulfate for complete reaction. The equations for the reactions are: Cl2 + 2I (cid:314) I2 + 2Cl I2 + 2S2O3 2 2 (cid:314) 2I + S4O6 (i) Show that the concentration of chlorine, Cl2, in this sample meets the UK recommended requirements. All steps in your calculation must be shown. (3) 20 *P44881A02024*<br />  (ii) Analysing a single sample of swimming pool water in this way is likely to give unreliable results because it is not possible to repeat the titration. Suggest another way in which this method is unreliable. (1)(d) One advantage of the bromine disinfection system is that, while chloric(I) acid decomposes in sunlight forming hydrogen chloride and oxygen, bromic(I) acid (HOBr) is stable. Another advantage is that bromine is less volatile than chlorine. (i) Write an equation for the decomposition of chloric(I) acid in sunlight. State symbols are not required.

Write your answers in the spaces provided. 24 Stereoisomerism Stereoisomerism occurs when species have the same formula and their atoms are bonded in the same sequence, but the spatial orientation of the atoms is different. Stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images are optical isomers, or enantiomers. These have identical chemical and physical properties, apart from their effect on plane-polarized light. Optical isomerism arises most simply when a tetrahedral atom has four different groups bonded to it, but the presence of such a system does not necessarily result in an optical isomer. Stereoisomers that are not enantiomers are called diastereoisomers. Complex optically active species can be diastereoisomers, but a more familiar example is found with geometric isomers. In organic chemistry, geometric isomerism may arise when there is an energetic barrier to free rotation. Restricted rotation occurs with double bonds, because a (cid:652) bond is formed by the lateral overlap of p orbitals, and also with cyclic compounds. Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and can be separated by conventional techniques. Stereoisomerism is not confined to organic chemistry. Inorganic compounds may also show stereoisomerism and it is a particular feature of transition metal complexes. The simplest geometric isomers in transition metal complexes occur in square planar complexes ML2N2 and octahedral complexes ML4N2, where M is the metal ion and L and N are ligands. Geometric isomerism also occurs with octahedral complexes of the type ML3N3. The most important optical isomers of transition metals are octahedral complexes of the type MB3 where B is a bidentate ligand; the structure of an enantiomer of MB3 is shown below. The stability of complexes with polydentate ligands makes them easier to prepare.

OH OH naphthalene phthalic anhydride benzene-1,2- dicarboxylic acid The use of naphthalene as a source of these compounds gave rise to the common names, phthalic acid for benzene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid and terephthalic acid for benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid. The alkyl esters derived from benzene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid are known as phthalates. Phthalates are used as plasticisers to increase the flexibility of many common plastics. However, some phthalates are known to be endocrine disruptors and recent studies have raised concerns about their role in the fall in human fertility rates. Because phthalates are used in making plastic drinks bottles and leach readily out of the structure, they are easily ingested.

At a temperature between 25 C and 70 C there is a transition and the solubility becomes that of Na2SO4. The units of solubility are grams per one hundred grams of water, g / 100 g water. An experiment was carried out to investigate this solubility and determine the transition temperature between the two forms of sodium sulfate.An empty boiling tube was weighed and the mass recorded. Some distilled water was added to the boiling tube and the new mass recorded. A small sample of hydrated sodium sulfate was added and this new mass recorded. The boiling tube was carefully heated with stirring until all the solid had dissolved. The apparatus was cooled slowly while constantly stirring and the temperature recorded when therst crystals appeared in the tube. (a) The results of several of these experiments are recorded below. Process the results in the table to calculate the solubility, in g / 100 g water, of the sodium sulfate for each of the temperatures listed.

It forms structures analogous to graphite and diamond because it is isoelectronic with these corresponding carbon structures. Boron nitride has also been used to form nanotube structures in a similar way to carbon. Just as synthetic diamonds are produced from graphite by using high temperatures and high pressures, the diamond-like cubic boron nitride can also be made from heating the graphite-like hexagonal boron nitride under high pressure. Boron nitride forms ceramic materials with very high thermal and chemical stability and, a wide range of uses. For example, they are stable in air up to 1000(cid:113)C, which is an advantage over similar graphite materials. The hexagonal form of boron nitride is a very effective lubricant and is also used in cosmetics. However, it is an electrical insulator, in contrast to graphite, which is a good electrical conductor.

"SECTION B Answer ALL the questions. Write your answers in the spaces provided. 21 This is a question about Group 2 compounds. Limewater is a solution of calcium hydroxide, commonly used in the identification of carbon dioxide gas. Since calcium hydroxide is only sparingly soluble in water, technicians often make the solution by adding an excess of the solid calcium hydroxide to the required volume of deionised water, shaking the container and then leaving the mixture to settle. In this way, a saturated solution is produced but it can be of variable concentration. Two students were each given a sample of limewater, from the same batch, in order to determine its concentration. Using 50.0 cm3 portions of the limewater, they carried out titrations using 0.100 mol dm3 hydrochloric acid. One of the students obtained the following results: Titration Final Volume /cm3 Initial Volume /cm3 Volume Added /cm3 Trial 14.50 0.00 14.50 28.60 14.50 14.10 42.70 28.60 14.10 The student decided that the mean titre was 14.10 cm3 The equation for the reaction is: Ca(OH)2(aq) + 2HCl(aq) o CaCl2(aq) + 2H2O(l) (a) (i) Calculate the number of moles of hydrochloric acid that reacted.

Some chemicals are commonly called after one particular flavour or aroma, such as: strawberry furanone cucumber aldehyde OH CH3 However, a flavour such as strawberry is not created from just one chemical but can be from a mixture containing many different chemicals, all of which can interact with various receptors in the mouth and the nose. For example, one strawberry milkshake product contains 59 different ingredients in order to achieve the required strawberry flavour. In order to detect the different chemical components of a particular flavour, a number of chemical techniques can be employed. One such technique is GCMS, Gas Chromatography Mass Spectometry. The volatile chemicals are first separated by gas chromatography and then detected and analysed by mass spectrometry. The flavour of various chemicals and their mixtures can be altered by the ways in which they are processed or cooked. For example, the Maillard reaction is promoted by heating and is responsible for the browning of bread and results in the formation of toast, which has a different flavour to the uncooked bread.

PMT II III IV VI VII A solution of the copper salt reacts with excess acidified potassium iodide, producing iodine. This iodine is then titrated with aqueous sodium thiosulfate, using starch indicator. FA 1 is an aqueous solution of the copper salt prepared by dissolving 26.0 g of the salt to make 1.00 dm3 of solution. FA 2 is dilute sulfuric acid, H2SO4. FA 3 is aqueous potassium iodide, KI. FA 4 is 0.110 mol dm3 sodium thiosulfate, Na2S2O3. starch indicator (a) MethodFill the burette with FA 4. Pipette 25.0 cm3 of FA 1 into a conical flask. Use the measuring cylinder to add approximately 10 cm3 of FA 2 to the same conical flask. Use the measuring cylinder to add approximately 20 cm3 of FA 3 to the mixture in the conical flask. The mixture will now be a brown colour, due to iodine produced in the reaction. Begin your rough titration by adding FA 4 from the burette until the mixture becomes light brown. Add 10 drops of starch indicator. The mixture will become darker. Continue titrating until the mixture becomes an off-white colour. This is the end-point. Add one drop of starch indicator to check that no traces of dark colour are produced. If the mixture stays off-white, the titration is finished. If some dark colour is produced, because iodine is still present, continue the titration. Record your burette readings and the rough titre in the space below. The rough titre iscm3. Carry out as many accurate titrations as you think necessary to obtain consistent results. Make sure any recorded results show the precision of your practical work.

Write your answers in the spaces provided. 25 Read the passage below carefully and answer the questions which follow. The general formula of most naturally occurring amino acids can be written RCH(NH2)COOH, though in some amino acids, such as proline, the nitrogen atom is part of a five-membered ring. Amino acids are water soluble, though the extent of their solubility varies. All but one of the naturally occurring amino acids show optical activity. The formula of the R group for some naturally occurring amino acids is shown below. Amino acid Formula of R group serine lysine phenylalanine leucine iso-leucine alanine CH2OH (CH2)4NH2 CH2C6H5 CH2CH(CH3)2 CH(CH3)CH2CH3 CH3 Mixtures of amino acids can be separated by electrophoresis. This method depends on amino acids moving different distances through paper or gel when an electric field is applied. They can also be separated by chromatography. Ninhydrin, shown below, is the chemical which is used to locate the position of the amino acids on chromatograms. OH OH Ninhydrin detects ammonia and primary and secondary amines. When it reacts with primary amines, a deep blue or purple colour is produced in a complex series of reactions. With proline, a yellow compound forms. Ninhydrin is widely used to detect fingerprints. Sweat secretions from ridges on the finger contain dipeptides and proteins. These are left on porous surfaces such as paper, and react with ninhydrin. When ninhydrin reacts with amino acids, carbon dioxide is released from the carboxylic acid group. Archaeologists have used this reaction to release the carbon from proteins in ancient bones, and, by comparing the proportions of carbon and nitrogen in the remains, they have obtained evidence for the diets of these animals. 20 *P45073RA02028*<br />  (a) (i) At a pH of 5.68, serine exists as a zwitterion. Draw the formula of serine at this pH. (1) *(ii) At pH 5.68, serine and lysine can be separated by electrophoresis. By considering the structures of the amino acids at this pH, suggest why this separation occurs. (2)*(b) Serine is very soluble in water, whilst phenylalanine is much less soluble. Explain the difference, disregarding any effect of zwitterion formation. (2)(c) The naturally occurring amino acid which does not show optical activity is not shown in the table.

Procedure 1. The coins were weighed and dissolved in concentrated nitric acid, producing a solution which contained copper(II) nitrate. 2. The solution containing copper(II) nitrate was neutralized by adding sodium carbonate solution until a precipitate of copper(II) carbonate just appeared. Dilute ethanoic acid was then added, drop by drop, until the copper(II) carbonate precipitate just dissolved. 3. The solution containing copper(II) nitrate was transferred to a volumetric flask and made up to 250 cm3 with distilled water. 4. 25 cm3 portions of this solution were transferred to separate conical flasks.

The use of potassium iodate(V) is preferred to potassium iodide because, in hot and humid conditions, the potassium iodate(V) can be stored for much longer. A very old sample of potassium iodate(V) tablets, which originally contained 85 mg of KIO3 per tablet, was analysed using the following procedure. A tablet was crushed, dissolved in deionised water and the solution and washings added to a conical flask. Then potassium iodide, KI, and hydrochloric acid, both in excess, were added to the conical flask. This mixture was titrated with 0.0600 mol dm3 sodium thiosulfate solution. This procedure was repeated and the following burette readings were obtained.

Complex ions are ions in which a number of molecules or anions are bonded to a central metal cation. Some of the first research on complex ions was carried out about 100 years ago, and demonstrated that there were two isomers with the molecular formula Co(NH3)4Cl3. In aqueous solution, many transition metal ions are surrounded by six water molecules forming ions such as [Cu(H2O)6]2+. Complex ions, such as haem, are also found in biological systems. The haem groups are large organic molecules containing nitrogen atoms, which form complex ions with Fe2+. The shape of a complex ion depends on the number of bonds from the ligands to the central metal ion, and the different shapes can result in different types of stereoisomerism. *(a) Explain why the formation of complex ions is a characteristic of transition metals, but Group 1 metals, such as sodium, do not show this property in general.

The iron ions in solution were then reduced to iron(II) ions with a suitable metal and these ions were then titrated with 0.0100 mol dm3 potassium manganate(VII) solution. The iron(II) ions were oxidized to iron(III) ions in the titration. Why must the ethanedioate ions be decomposed before determining the concentration of iron(II) ions?

The chemically important component of limestone is calcium carbonate and the proportion of this compound determines the quality of the material. One method of determining the proportion of calcium carbonate in limestone involves dissolving the limestone in acid and precipitating the calcium ions as calcium ethanedioate. The precipitate is filtered and then re-dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid. The concentration of ethanedioate ions is determined by titration with a solution of potassium manganate(VII) of known concentration. In one such determination, 1.77 g of limestone produced 250 cm3 of calcium ethanedioate solution and 25.0 cm3 samples of this solution were titrated at about 70 C with potassium manganate(VII) solution of concentration 0.0205 mol dm3.

Write your answers in the spaces provided. SECTION C A major function of the chemical industry is the manufacture of perfumes and flavourings. Perfumes were originally made from natural products, such as spermaceti from whales or civetone from the civet cat. The use of synthetic equivalents is generally cheaper and the supply is more reliable, and does not require the animals to be killed which obtaining spermaceti did. Synthetic perfumes and flavourings are usually nature-identical, although naturally-occurring molecules that have stereoisomers are sometimes produced synthetically as mixtures since the stereospecific synthesis required might be difficult to achieve economically. Some chiral molecules have a different taste depending on which enantiomer is present. The enantiomer ()-carvone tastes and smells of spearmint, and its mirror-image, (+)-carvone, of caraway or dill. In some cases only one enantiomer has any taste; this is true for glucose. The mirror image molecule of naturally occurring glucose has no taste and cannot even be absorbed or metabolized. Many drug molecules are chiral, though paracetamol is not. The wrong isomer present in a drug may be positively damaging, which was the case with thalidomide. In order to synthesize optically-pure drug molecules, it is important to understand the mechanism of any reaction used. Using an SN1 reaction which involves the chiral centre would result in the product mixture being racemic. It is advantageous to use stereospecific catalysts wherever possible, and industry on the whole prefers to use heterogeneous rather than homogeneous catalysts.

A useful method of comparing fats and oils is by measuring their iodine values. An iodine value is the amount of iodine in grams that reacts with 100 g of a fat or oil. The iodine value is a measure of the degree of unsaturation of the fat or oil. The iodine value of sunflower oil can be determined in the following way. Add 0.200 g of sunflower oil to a 250 cm3 conical flask. Add 10 cm3 of solvent to dissolve the oil. Add 10.0 cm3 of a solution of iodine monochloride, called Wijs solution.

Titrate the liberated iodine with 0.100 mol dm3 sodium thiosulfate solution. This gives the sample titre.

A great deal of attention has been directed at developing the use of hydrogen as a fuel. Since the only product of its combustion is water, hydrogen is considered to be a clean fuel. However, the use of hydrogen has major drawbacks. The small size of the hydrogen molecule means that it is difficult to prevent leaks and, to store enough to provide a reasonable amount of fuel for a car, hydrogen must be compressed to around 700 atmospheres. Furthermore, the main source of hydrogen is currently fossil fuels such as methane, which is combined with steam in a series of reactions to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. One suggested alternative to hydrogen is ammonia. Ammonia, which is obtained by combining nitrogen and hydrogen at temperatures around 450C and pressures of about 150 atmospheres, also has serious disadvantages: it is a toxic, corrosive and pungent gas which is difficult to ignite. However, burning ammonia produces only nitrogen and water and it is relatively easy to liquefy, having a boiling temperature of just 33C. Furthermore, the technology works: ammonia was used as a fuel for Belgian buses in the Second World War and, in 2007, the NH3 Car project based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, used a mixture of ammonia and petrol to fuel a 2500 mile journey, from Detroit to San Francisco, in a modified pickup truck.

(2)(iii) Write the equation for the formation of hydrogen from methane and steam. State symbols are not required. (iv) Suggest why using methane to form hydrogen in this way is preferable to burning methane directly. (2) (1)(v) Storing hydrogen at a pressure of 700 atmospheres is a disadvantage to its use as a fuel because of the costs involved. Suggest why using such high pressures is so expensive. (1)(b) (i) Draw a dot and cross diagram for ammonia, showing the outer electrons only. (1) *P39307A01720* 17 Turn over<br />  *(ii) By considering the intermolecular forces involved, explain why methane has a boiling temperature of 109 K while ammonia has a boiling temperature of 240 K, although these two compounds have very similar molar masses. (4)(c) (i) Write the equation for the combustion of ammonia. State symbols are not required. (2) (ii) The enthalpy change of combustion of methane is 890.3 kJ mol1 and that of ammonia is 510.1 kJ mol1. Suggest two additional items of information, not connected with environmental factors or the fact that methane is non-renewable, which would be useful in comparing methane and ammonia as fuels.

N O Nitrogen monoxide is an important chemical messenger in all mammals and, at appropriate concentrations, it is vital to life; however, at high concentrations in the body, it is extremely toxic. Nitrogen monoxide is considered a dangerous atmospheric pollutant; it is involved in the formation of a range of toxic substances, including ozone, at low altitudes, and in the depletion of the ozone layer at high altitudes. Nitrogen monoxide is formed by the direct combination of nitrogen and oxygen at high temperatures, a reaction that occurs naturally in lightning discharges, and as a by- product of the reactions in internal combustion and jet engines. Catalytic converters reduce nitrogen monoxide emissions from car engines by catalysing the reaction between nitrogen monoxide and carbon monoxide to form nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The reactions of nitrogen monoxide which involve ozone in the atmosphere are summarised below. 2NO(g) + O2(g) (cid:85) 2NO2(g) NO2(g) UV radiation NO(g) + O(g) O2(g) + O(g) NO(g) + O3(g) O3(g) NO2(g) + O2(g) When the ratio of nitrogen dioxide to nitrogen monoxide is high (&gt; 3), the rate of formation of ozone is faster than its rate of removal. When the ratio is low (&lt; 0.3), the reverse is true. Ozone causes breathing difficulties, headaches, fatigue and can aggravate respiratory problems.

People at the time thought that the graphite was a form of lead. Nowadays, graphite is used in pencils but it is still referred to as pencil lead. A student decided to investigate the number of carbon atoms in a pencil lead. He found that the mass of the pencil lead was 0.321 g. (i) Calculate the amount, in mol, of carbon atoms in the students pencil lead. Assume that the pencil lead is pure graphite. (ii) Using the Avogadro constant, NA, calculate the number of carbon atoms in the students pencil lead. answer =mol [1] number of carbon atoms =[1] [Total: 11]OCR 2009\n", "PMT SECTION C Answer ALL the questions. Write your answers in the spaces provided. 16 This question is about some reactions which can be used in the manufacture of hydrogen. Reaction 1 uses two naturally occurring chemicals, water and natural gas. Steam is reacted with methane to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen in an equilibrium reaction. Reaction 1 CH4(g) + H2O(g) (cid:85) CO(g) + 3H2(g) (cid:507)H = +210 kJ mol1 In reaction 2, carbon monoxide and steam are passed over copper at high temperature. This forms carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Reaction 2 CO(g) + H2O(g) (cid:85) CO2(g) + H2(g) The carbon dioxide formed is removed by passing it through potassium carbonate solution in reaction 3. Reaction 3 K2CO3(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l) (cid:111) 2KHCO3(aq) The potassium carbonate is regenerated by heating the potassium hydrogencarbonate solution in reaction 4. The carbon dioxide gas produced is released into the atmosphere. Reaction 4 2KHCO3(aq) (cid:111) K2CO3(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l) (a) For each of the first three reactions, state the initial and final oxidation numbers of any elements that change their oxidation numbers. Hence decide which are redox reactions.

Write your answers in the spaces provided. 23 Anaesthetics Substances have been used to relieve or eliminate pain during medical procedures for well over two thousand years. However, uncertainty about the nature and purity of the plant extracts being used and in standardising their application prompted Fallopius, a leading sixteenth century physician, to complain When soporifics are weak, they are useless, and when strong, they kill. Modern analytical techniques have all but eliminated these problems. Anaesthetics are divided into two broad categories: general anaesthetics, which cause a reversible loss of consciousness, and local anaesthetics, which result in the absence of pain sensation in the area where they are applied. General anaesthetics may be delivered by inhalation or injection, while local anaesthetics may be injected or applied directly to the surface. The structures of some anaesthetics are shown below. Ethoxyethane (Tb = 34.5(cid:113)C) OH Desflurane (Tb = 23.5(cid:113)C) Procaine Propofol H2N H2N Benzocaine Ethoxyethane was first synthesized in 1540 by distilling a mixture of ethanol and concentrated sulfuric acid. Although its anaesthetic properties were established at this time, it was not until the nineteenth century that it was used as an inhalational general anaesthetic in medical procedures. However, ethoxyethane is highly flammable and has unpleasant side effects, so it has been entirely replaced by compounds like desflurane in modern medical practice. Propofol is a general anaesthetic which is administered by injection. Procaine and benzocaine are local anaesthetics and are examples of aminoester anaesthetics. 22 *P42989rA02228*<br />  (a) (i) Explain why ethoxyethane has a lower boiling temperature than ethanol (Tb = 78.5(cid:113)C) even though an ethanol molecule has fewer electrons. A detailed explanation of the forces involved is not required. (3)*(ii) Desflurane is approximately 3700 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and it has been estimated that the worldwide use of inhalational anaesthetics contributes the equivalent of 1 million cars to global warming. Suggest three factors that might be considered before deciding whether this type of general anaesthetic should be banned. (3)*P42989rA02328* 23 Turn over<br />  (iii) Suggest why desflurane is much more stable than ethoxyethane and why the chemical stability of desflurane increases its potential to cause damage to the environment. (2)*(b) Procaine is often used by dentists and administered by injection. Due to the presence of the amine groups, procaine is a basic compound. Explain why the presence of an amine group makes a compound basic and hence compare the effect of each amine group on the basicity of procaine. (3)24 *P42989rA02428*<br />  (c) The aminoester, benzocaine, is a local anaesthetic used in creams and cough drops. It can be made from 4-aminobenzoic acid, the structure of which is shown below.

For example, Magnesite is used as a catalyst in the production of synthetic rubber and also to make magnesium oxide which is an important refractory lining for furnaces and kilns. In addition, magnesium ions are found in significant quantities in sea water, from which magnesium chloride, MgCl2, can be obtained. Magnesium chloride is used as a raw material for the production of the compound magnesium hydroxide. Epsom salts contain magnesium sulfate and have a range of medicinal and other uses, including soothing aches and pains in a relaxing bath, as a topical gel for sore joints, as a laxative and as a first-aid remedy for barium chloride poisoning. In green plants, magnesium ions, Mg2+, are at the centre of the chlorophyll molecule and are vital to the process of photosynthesis. Hence magnesium compounds are commonly included in fertilizers to ensure healthy crops. The pure form of magnesium metal also has various uses, including being a sacrificial anode for underground piping, and in flares and fireworks.

Molecular structure and colour chemistry The sight of tubes of paint or of coloured pencils in an artists supply shop is something that most people enjoy; we love colour. The ability to synthesise brightly-coloured compounds coincides with the rapid growth of the organic chemicals industry. Synthetic organic dyes started to appear in the mid-19th century when William Perkin synthesised Mauve in 1856 at the age of 18. He was trying to synthesise quinine even though he did not know the structure of the molecule. In the 19th century many chemists did not believe that molecules existed. The work of Butlerov, Couper, and notably Kekul showed that molecules not only exist but have specific structures. In 1865 Kekul suggested a ring structure for the aromatic compound benzene which he represented as Kekul knew that benzene does not react with bromine water. Later work showed that the enthalpy change of hydrogenation of the compound is 205 kJ mol1, rather than the value of 360 kJ mol1 that would be expected if the structure was exactly as shown above, given that the enthalpy change of hydrogenation for cyclohexene to cyclohexane is 120 kJ mol1. + H2 + H2 When Greiss in 1856 discovered diazotisation and the azo dyes, he used a reaction characteristic of aromatic amines. Witt, in 1876, found the functional groups in the dye molecule that make it water-soluble and enable it to attach to the cloth fibres. Graebe, Liebermann and Perkin in 1869 patented the synthesis of alizarin, found in madder root grown in Holland and Von Baeyer synthesised indigo in 1880, until then grown in India. Synthetic dyes were made available in large quantities and were cheaper than the sources from plants. Now the organic chemical industry produces a vast range of pigments and dyestuffs for use in paints and for fabrics, inks and other materials, making our world the most colourful that it has ever been. 20 *P35302A02028*<br />  PMT (a) (i) Explain why Perkins attempted synthesis of quinine was almost certain to fail.

Freshly-cut grass has a characteristic aroma because of the increased release of these compounds, which are known as green leaf volatiles (GLVs). The most important contributors to this aroma are alcohols and aldehydes containing six carbon atoms. The main compound giving freshly-cut grass its smell is Z-hex-3-enal. The human nose can detect Z-hex-3-enal at levels as low as 1.0 ng dm3 or 1.0109 g dm3. However, this compound is relatively unstable and rearranges to form the E isomer. Some other GLVs are methanol, ethanol, Z-hex-3-en-1-ol and E-hex-2-enal. It has been suggested that the release of these GLVs is part of a defence response by the plant. In one study of plants attacked by caterpillars, the chemical composition of the GLVs changed to attract the natural insect predators of these caterpillars.

SECTION C Carbon capture is the name given to some processes used to prevent carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere. Carbon capture is carried out because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Flue gases in chimneys contain carbon dioxide produced from burning fossil fuels. Various different compounds can be used to react with the carbon dioxide to capture it. Alternatively, carbon dioxide can be separated from other gases by a physical process. Many sources of natural gas contain carbon dioxide, which can be removed by freezing. Captured carbon dioxide must then be stored to prevent it entering the atmosphere. It can be injected into depleted oil and gas formations, or into porous rocks full of salt water. These are usually over 1 km below the Earths surface and have non-porous rocks above them. Eventually the carbon dioxide dissolves, forming carbonate ions and then new minerals.

A useful method of comparing fats and oils is to measure their iodine values. An iodine value is the amount of iodine in grams that reacts with 100 g of a fat or oil. This measures the degree of unsaturation of the fat or oil. The iodine value of olive oil can be determined in the following way. Add 0.200 g of olive oil to a 250 cm3 conical flask. Add 10 cm3 of solvent to dissolve the oil. Add 10.0 cm3 of a solution of iodine monochloride, called Wijs solution. Stopper the flask and allow to stand in the dark for half an hour.

The simplest organic nitrogen compounds are amines, which may be regarded as derivatives of ammonia in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms of ammonia have been replaced by an alkyl group or an aryl group. Some simple amines are shown below. H3C NH2 H3C H3C NH methylamine dimethylamine H3C CH3 H3C trimethylamine NH2 phenylamine (aniline) Amines with one alkyl group are called primary, with two alkyl groups secondary and with three alkyl groups tertiary. Because of the presence of nitrogen, the physical and chemical properties of alkyl amines are similar to those of ammonia but the similarities are less marked with phenylamine. Amides are carboxylic acid derivatives which have a carbonyl group adjacent to an amine group. The simplest amide is ethanamide: H3C C NH2 ethanamide Because the two groups are adjacent, the chemical properties of amides are different from those of amines. Amino acids are compounds with an amine group and a carboxylic acid group. The presence of these two functional groups gives amino acids properties that are also different from those of amines. The great significance of the amino acids is their ability to form polymers called polypeptides, leading to the formation of proteins, the building blocks of life. To form polypeptides, amino acids are joined by the amide group, sometimes called the peptide link. *P45045A02328* 23 Turn over<br />  (a) Methylamine boils at 267 K and dissolves in water to form an alkaline solution.

You are reminded that the approximate solubility of chlorine is 5 g dm3 at 25 C. The following information gives some of the hazards associated with chlorine, iodine and sodium thiosulfate. Saturated chlorine water is low hazard but chlorine gas escapes, which is harmful. Iodine is harmful by inhalation and in contact with skin or eyes. Solutions more concentrated than or equal to 1 mol dm3 are harmful. Sodium thiosulfate is non-hazardous. Aqueous chlorine, Cl 2, displaces iodine, I2, from aqueous potassium iodide. Cl 2(aq) + 2KI(aq)I2(aq) + 2KCl (aq) Therefore if a solution of chlorine is mixed with an excess of aqueous potassium iodide, iodine is displaced in a 1 : 1 molar ratio with chlorine.

A new catalyst that can break down carbon dioxide gas could allow us to use carbon from the atmosphere as a fuel source in a similar way to plants. Plants break the stable bonds in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. In the natural process, the carbon dioxide molecule is initially bonded to nitrogen atoms, making reactive compounds called carbamates. Carbamates are derivatives of carbamic acid, NH2CO2H. These compounds can then be broken down, allowing the carbon to be used in the synthesis of other plant products such as sugars and proteins. A new catalyst produced by scientists is a graphite-like compound made from flat layers of carbon and nitrogen atoms arranged in hexagons. Carbon dioxide binds to the catalyst and takes part in the following reaction, which occurs at 150C and at about three times atmospheric pressure. benzene phenol C6H6 + CO2C6H5OH + CO Carbon monoxide can then be used to make liquid fuels such as methanol. The energy required for photosynthesis comes from light, and experiments are now going on to develop a light activated catalyst which could break down carbon dioxide in a new process.

The percentage of alcohol in a drink can be determined by a redox titration, whilst the amount of alcohol present on the breath of someone who has consumed such a drink can be estimated using a breathalyser. The earliest breathalysers used the colour change that occurs when dichromate(VI) ions react with ethanol to measure the amount of alcohol. Later models measure the current from a fuel cell. Cheaper versions of these meters are available for drivers to buy for self-testing. Some police forces also use fuel cell breathalysers in conjunction with infrared breath analysers, which can determine the amounts of alcohol from an infrared spectrum. In an experiment to find out the concentration of ethanol in a drink, a small beaker containing 5.00 cm3 of a diluted sample of the drink is suspended above 10.0 cm3 of excess acidified sodium dichromate(VI) solution, of concentration 0.0800 mol dm3, and left for 24 hours in a warm place. 5 cm3 of diluted sample 10 cm3 of acidified sodium dichromate(VI) solution The ethanol vaporizes and reacts with some of the acidified sodium dichromate(VI) ions.

Chemists have discovered that nitrogen monoxide plays an important role in the body by dilating blood vessels. If someone is suffering from blood circulatory or heart problems, a chemical may be given which will quickly break down to give nitrogen monoxide. Years ago, nitroglycerine was used for this purpose. Interestingly, the same chemical Nobel had used to make dynamite was used to treat him in old age. In the laboratory, nitrogen monoxide can be prepared by adding concentrated nitric acid to powdered silver. Nitrogen monoxide is a colourless gas which is partially soluble in water. It is difficult to detect its smell, because it reacts with oxygen in the air to form pungent-smelling nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen monoxide is formed when a mixture of air and oxygen is heated to a high temperature. This reaction occurs in the engines of cars and aeroplanes. Nitrogen monoxide has a disastrous effect on the ozone layer because it is a free radical. Nitrogen monoxide is also a greenhouse gas. (a) (i) What is meant by the term free radical?

One such compound is silane, SiH4, which is analogous to methane, CH4. Methane is the main gas that is used in school and college laboratories with Bunsen burners, but it requires a spark or a lighted splint to ignite. Silane does not require any such ignition, and at room temperature is spontaneously flammable. This can make an interesting chemical demonstration. One method of making silane is by mixing together two solids, silicon dioxide and magnesium, with the magnesium being in excess. The two chemicals are thoroughly mixed together. This mixture is then heated to red-heat and initially produces powdered silicon. The silicon then reacts further with the excess magnesium powder and forms magnesium silicide, Mg2Si.

OCH3 OH OCH3 OCCH3 H C H2C C H2 H C H2C C H2 Eugenol Eugenol ethanoate Eugenol is used in perfumes, the manufacture of food flavourings and as a local anaesthetic. Eugenol ethanoate is mainly used in perfumes and aftershaves. Although used for many years, both compounds are classified as harmful and have been tested to determine their toxicity by ingestion. However, humans would need to consume very large amounts to reach toxic levels. The compounds are the main constituents of clove oil which can be extracted from the dried buds of Eugenia aromaticums flowers. Traditionally the oil is extracted by steam distillation, though a greater yield of oil can be obtained using a Soxhlet extractor to pass a chlorinated solvent through the dried buds several times to dissolve the clove oil. An alternative technique uses carbon dioxide as a solvent. Above a temperature of 304 K and a high pressure of 73.8 atm, carbon dioxide behaves as a supercritical fluid and when passed through the clove buds, it dissolves the clove oil. Releasing the pressure causes the carbon dioxide to turn back into a gas, leaving the clove oil behind.

SECTION C 23 Coloured substances Coloured substances, both natural and synthetic, have long been of interest to the human race. For example, there are over 130 minerals that have been used as gemstones. The corundum minerals, which include rubies and sapphires, are mainly aluminium oxide. Rubies have some of the aluminium ions replaced by chromium(III) ions and they range in colour from pink to deep red. Sapphires occur in many different colours including blue, yellow, purple, orange and green. Diamond is an allotrope of carbon. It is the hardest naturally occurring substance. Diamonds are often colourless but the presence of nitrogen atoms in natural diamonds gives them a brown or yellow colour, whilst the presence of boron gives them a blue colour. Dyes and pigments have been developed as colouring materials. Dyes are applied as a solution, whilst pigments are solids that are ground into a fine powder and made into a suspension with a suitable liquid. Methyl red is an azo dye and is used as an indicator. Its structure is CH3 CH3 COOH Prussian Blue, Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3, (discovered in 1704) is a deep blue colour and was one of the first synthetic pigments. It is used as a pigment in paints. Colour can arise in many different ways; for example, the colours seen in flame tests and in transition metal compounds. 24 *P46665A02432* D O N O T W R I T E I N T H I S A R E A D O N O T W R I T E I N T H I S A R E A D O N O T W R I T E I N T H I S A R E A<br />  A E R A S I H T N I E T I R W T O N O D A E R A S I H T N I E T I R W T O N O D A E R A S I H T N I E T I R W T O N O D (a) (i) Explain why complex ions containing chromium(III) ions are coloured.

SECTION C As levels of fossil fuel resources are getting lower, society is increasingly looking at the use of biofuels as alternatives to coal, oil and gas. Biofuels are derived from plants and examples include bioethanol, biodiesel and Miscanthus, a plant more commonly known as elephant grass. These fuels have the advantage of being renewable and the plants take in carbon dioxide as they grow. Bioethanol is produced from crops such as sugar cane or corn. The raw plant material is treated to produce a sugary solution which is then fermented to produce ethanol, water and carbon dioxide gas. The ethanol is removed by distillation. The resulting solution contains about 96 % ethanol. The remaining water has to be removed by absorption using a suitable drying agent so that the ethanol can burn efficiently. The bioethanol can then be burnt alone or mixed with petrol in vehicle engines. Biodiesel is formed by the hydrolysis of vegetable oils using sodium hydroxide solution, followed by esterification with methanol and a sodium hydroxide catalyst. Biodiesel can then be used on its own in diesel-engined vehicles or mixed with diesel derived from crude oil. Plants which are used to produce the vegetable oils include rapeseed in the UK, soya bean in the USA and palm oil in Asia. Miscanthus, or elephant grass, is a quick growing, high-yield plant that grows up to four metres in height. After harvesting, the grass is left to dry and then burnt in power stations designed to run on solid fuels such as coal. In the United Kingdom, farms that produce elephant grass are normally situated within 50 miles of such a power station. In an experiment to simulate the production of bioethanol, a student produced a water/ ethanol mixture by fermentation of sucrose solution using yeast. It was then proposed to separate the ethanol from water by carrying out a distillation on the mixture. The mixture would then be dried using a suitable drying agent. 23 (a) Draw a diagram to show the most significant intermolecular force between an ethanol molecule and a water molecule.

Write your answers in the spaces provided. SECTION C 20 Fireworks are designed to explode in a controlled manner with bursts of brightly coloured light and loud bangs. It is believed that fireworks originated in China, after the discovery of gunpowder over 1000 years ago. Fireworks essentially consist of: (cid:404) colour-producing compounds (often metal salts) (cid:404) (cid:404) oxidizer (cid:404) binders (often a type of starch) (cid:404) fuse. fuel In addition, there may be substances known as chlorine donors to strengthen the colour, regulators to control the rate of reaction and reducing agents to produce hot gases. Inside the firework are small globules, called stars, which give fireworks their colour when they explode, for example calcium carbonate is used to produce an orange-red colour. If these stars are arranged randomly, then they will spread out in the sky on explosion. However, if the stars are packed in a regular pattern, then, on explosion, a particular shape can be created in the sky. (a) Give the formulae of two metal carbonates that could be used to produce a bright red colour from an exploding firework. (2)*(b) Explain, by reference to electronic transitions, how the metal ions produce the colours of the firework.

SECTION C 22 Metal Complexes Complexes involve ligands forming dative covalent bonds with a central cation; the number of dative covalent bonds is the coordination number of the cation in the complex. Complexes may be positive, negative or neutral. The ligands may be neutral or negatively charged, but are never positively charged. The ligands must have a lone pair of electrons. In some complexes the central atom is neutral, as is the case with nickel carbonyl which is used in the Mond process for the purification of nickel: Ni(s) + 4CO(g) (cid:85)(cid:1)(cid:1)Ni(CO)4(g) The formation of complexes is typical of transition metals but other elements also form complexes. Zinc, which is a d block element but not a transition metal, and aluminium, which is a Group 3 element, both form complexes. Transition metal complexes are usually coloured, but if the interaction between the ligand and the central ion is very strong, then the resulting complex may well be colourless. This is the case with the complex [FeF6]3. The ligand in a complex affects its redox properties and this is apparent from considering the relevant standard electrode potentials. For example, with copper(II) species: [Cu(H2O)6]2+(aq) + 2e (cid:85) Cu(s) + 6H2O(l) E (cid:57) = +0.34 V [Cu(H2O)2(NH3)4]2+(aq) + 2e (cid:85) Cu(s) + 2H2O(l) + 4NH3(aq) E (cid:57) = 0.05 V Complexes are industrially important, for example in the purification of nickel mentioned above and in the extraction of gold which involves the complex [Au(CN)2]. Complex formation is used in estimating the concentrations of metal ions in solution. Examples of this are the use of EDTA in titration and dimethylglyoxime in gravimetric analysis. Complexes are also used in qualitative analysis, for example, in Tollens reagent.

The structure of retinol is shown below. OH Retinol can be converted into retinal and a form of this is combined with an opsin molecule in the retina of the eye to make the light-sensitive pigment rhodopsin. When light enters the eye, the shape of the retinal molecule is changed, which results in it separating from the opsin molecule. The outcome of this separation is that we see light. Retinol can also be converted to retinoic acid, which is important in the body for the correct maintenance of mucous membranes. Failure to produce retinoic acid can lead to a condition known as dry eye, or xerophthalmia, which can result in blindness. The functions of this vitamin, and other nutrient molecules, illustrate the need for a healthy, balanced diet. (a) Retinol has an alcohol functional group.
