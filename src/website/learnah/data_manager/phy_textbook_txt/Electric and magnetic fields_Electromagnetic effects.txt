Thus, by adjusting the accelerating voltage and the strength of the electromagnet (by altering the current
through it) we can identify the various chemicals contained within a sample, as each is registered in the
detector. The intensity of the current in the detector can indicate the proportion of a given chemical
within the sample.
WORKED EXAMPLE
A company selling sea salt for cooking wanted to find out if its ratio of chlorine isotopes was different
from the usual abundance ratio. In nature, the 35Cl isotope is more common than the 37Cl one by a
factor of 3: 1. They analysed a sample of their product using a mass spectrometer that would ionise
the chlorine atoms into single minus ions. What would be the difference between the radii of curvature
caused for the chlorine isotopes, if the mass spectrometer operated at an accelerating potential of 3.0 kV
and had a magnetic field strength of 3.0T?

where q is the charge on the particle, vis its velocity, and is
the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field lines. A
simplified situation that is often considered is that of an electron
(charge 'e') moving at right angles to the field (sin 90ยบ = 1). This
reduces the formula to F = Bev, which is commonly remembered
by students as 'Fred = Bev'.
A chemical to be identified enters the machine and is ionised.
This charge will then allow it to be accelerated in two different
ways within the mass spectrometer. An electric field increases its
speed. Then it feels a force when travelling through the field of the
electromagnet, which changes its direction.

You can investigate how much force will be on an electron moving
across a magnetic field using equipment like that shown in fig C. The
grid allows you to observe the path travelled by the electrons, and
there is a standard formula for calculating the magnetic field strength

as Helmholtz coils.

fig D Schematic of the basic parts of a mass spectrometer.
The force on a charged particle moving at right angles to a
magnetic field is given by:
F = Bqv
Centripetal force is given by:
F=mv2
Thus for particles following the circular curve through the
electromagnet to emerge on a path to the detector:
Bqv = mv?
As the force on the charged particle is always at right angles to
the direction of its velocity, it acts as a centripetal force, and the
particle follows a circular path. As the charged particle's velocity
is constantly changing along a circular path, it is being accelerated
by the magnetic field. This means that given the right combination
of conditions, a moving charged particle could be held by a
magnetic field, continuously orbiting a central point. This is the
principle by which artificially generated anti-matter is contained,
to save it from annihilation, for future use or study.

The charge/mass ratio will identify the particles involved, so with
Band r(the radius of the curvature of the particle through the
mass spectrometer) known from the calibration of the machine, all
we need to know is how fast the particles were moving when they
entered the electromagnet. They are accelerated to this speed by an
electric field acting on their charge, and the kinetic energy gained
comes from the potential difference, V, that they pass through
according to

field will then determine whether it slows up the falling magnet
or repels it faster down the tube. If the latter were the case, then
the magnet would end up with more kinetic energy than the
gravitational potential it had at the start. This is impossible and so
the law of conservation of energy dictates Lenz's law:
The direction of an induced e.m.f. is such as to oppose the change
creating it.
In this way the e.m.f. induced in the tube acts to try and slow
down the magnet, as the movement of the magnet is the change
creating this e.m.f. The induced current around the copper
tube acts as an electromagnet, and the polarity of this induced
magnetic field is opposite to that of the falling magnet, so it slows
up the magnet's fall.

Questions
Fleming's right hand rule
The direction of an induced e.m.f. can be found using Fleming's right
hand rule (fig D). This is very similar to the left hand rule for the
motor effect. The reason that the opposite hand is needed is a
product of Lenz's law, in that the induced e.m.f. must be in a
direction which opposes the change producing it.

(b) The coil is turned through 90% within the 0.33 mT magnetic
field, moving from a position perpendicular to the field (full flux
linkage) to a position parallel to the field (zero flux linkage). This

Faraday's law told us that the e.m.f would be proportional to the

oppose the change creating it.
Faraday's law says that induced e.m.f. is proportional to the rate of
change of flux linkage.

Fleming's left hand rule
Magnetic fields can affect moving electric charges, as well as magnetic poles. If you place a wire in
a magnetic field and pass a current through it, the wire will feel a force on it (fig A). This is called the
motor effect. The effect is greatest when the wire and the magnetic field are at right angles. In this
instance, the force will be at right angles to both, in the third dimension, as shown by Fleming's left
hand rule in fig B.

Flux linkage
The interaction between magnetic fields and charged particles, or conductors, allows motors to
operate, and electricity to be generated. In most practical applications, magnetic flux is made to
interact with a coil of wire, as the effect on a single strand of wire is too small to be useful. If the
single wire is coiled up, then the magnetic field can interact with each turn on the coil, and so any
effect is multiplied N times, where N is the number of turns on the coil.
The amount of magnetic flux interacting with a coil of wire is known as the flux linkage, and is
simply the product of the number of turns of wire and the flux in that region:
Flux linkage = No measured in weber
Remembering that โ = BA means that we also have:
Flux linkage = BAN
WORKED EXAMPLE
Zora takes a wire and winds it into a coil of ten circular turns with a radius of 5 cm and then holds this in
a magnetic field with a strength of 20 mT. What is the flux linkage?

fig B Measuring the induced e.m.f. as a magnet falls through a coil of wire.
Electromagnetic induction
We have seen that the movement of a charged particle in a
magnetic field causes it to feel a force. Newton's third law of
motion reminds us that this force must have a counterpart that
acts equally in the opposite direction. Moreover, this pair of
electromagnetic forces is generated whenever there is relative
motion between a charge and a magnetic field. Thus, a magnetic
field moving past a stationary charge will create the same force.
The velocity term in the expression F = Bqv actually refers to the
relative (perpendicular) velocity between the magnetic field lines
and q. (Also remember that if the movement is not at right angles.
then we need to work out the component of it that is at right
angles by including the sin term: F= Bqvsin 6.)
This means that if we move a magnet near a wire, the electrons
in the wire will feel a force tending to make them move through
the wire. This is an e.m.f; if the wire is in a complete circuit, then
the electrons will move, forming an electric current. We can use
this principle to generate electricity. Reversing the direction of the
magnetic field, or the direction of the relative motion, will reverse
the direction of the force on the electrons, reversing the polarity
of the e.m.f.. Faraday's law states that the induced e.mf is
proportional to the rate of change of flux linkage.
Lenz's law
If you drop a magnet down a copper tube, it falls more slowly
than if you drop a similarly sized non-magnetic piece of metal
through it. As copper is not a magnetic material, the friction forces
should be identical on the two falling objects. This somewhat
bizarre result is a product of Lenz's law.
DO
fig C Lenz's law slows a magnet falling down a copper tube.
Imagine the copper tube is like a series of coils of copper wire all
stacked on top of each other. As the magnet falls through the tube,
it will induce an e.m.f. in each copper circlet, which will cause a
small current to flow around the tube. This circling current will
then generate an electromagnetic field, which will interact with
the falling magnet. The direction of this newly created magnetic

Investigation
Build your own motor
The forced movement of a current-carrying conductor within a
magnetic field is the fundamental principle that causes motors to
work. From Fleming's left hand rule, it is clear that if a coil of wire
carrying a current were placed in a magnetic field it would feel a
turning force, as the current travels in opposite directions on
opposite sides of the coil, thus causing forces in opposite directions,
tending to rotate the coil. If it is free to move, then the coil (or
motor) will spin continuously. If replicating the apparatus in fig E,

Mains electricity
In Section 7.3.4, we saw how an e.m.f can be induced by
changing the magnetic flux linkage with a conductor. If this is
extended to a coil which is made to rotate continuously in the
magnetic field, as in fig A, the e.mf will be induced constantly,
although it will keep changing direction as the coil's position
relative to the field keeps switching back and forth.

fig A An AC generator: continuously rotating this coil within the magnetic field
will induce an em.f. all the time, and so an alternating current will flow in
the circuit all the time.
In a complete circuit, the e.m.f will cause a current to flow, and
as the polarity (direction) of the e.m.f. is constantly switching,
the current will keep changing direction. This can be seen on the
graph shown in fig B, where the y-axis labelled 'output' could, with
appropriate units, refer either to the e.m.f across the bulb or the
current through it.
Peak values
As alternating current follows a sinusoidal waveform, its value is
constantly changing. If we start at zero, it rises to a peak value,
drops back through zero to negative values, reaching a maximum
negative value and then returns to zero, before repeating the cycle
again and again. This idea is true whether we are considering the
voltage or the current - they both follow the same wave shape.
The maximum value, regardless of sign, is called the peak value,
and we can measure the peak current, 10, or the peak voltage,
V. In the UK, the peak voltage of mains electricity is about
+325 V. The peak current value will depend on the actual circuit in
use, following Ohm's law.
WORKED EXAMPLE

Fig B shows us that alternating current follows a waveform, and
the same cycle will repeat continuously.

The voltage reading is shown on the screen by a small dot. The

able to see the changing height of the dot's trace on the screen. If the
dot moves fast enough, it will blur into a continuous line trace.
Learning tip
Root-mean-square values are a type of averaging technique. For an
AC waveform, we look over a whole cycle and for each value find the
square of it. Then we look at all these squared answers (which will all
be positive) and find the mean average of them. Finally, take the
square root of that average, and we have the 'root-of-the-mean-of-
the-squares' - 'root-mean-square'. You will see this comes up again
for the average speed of molecules in a gas sample, in Section 9.1.2.

Electromagnetic induction using an

In the previous section, the induction of e.m.f. was a result of the
relative motion between a conductor, or coil, and a permanent

just as easily be produced electrically by another coil. This is the
principle of operation of a transformer, and the coil producing the
initial magnetic field is referred to as the primary coil.

set at 5 ms divl, so the dot will move horizontally across the screen
at a rate of 1 square in 5 milliseconds. The voltage sensitivity is set at
10 mV div-l, so the dot will move vertically 1 square for every 10

Root-mean-square values
As the voltage and current values for AC are constantly changing,
what does it mean if we ask, "What is the voltage of this AC?' If
you look at the sinusoidal trace, you might say that on average
it was zero. Alternatively, you might choose to state the peak
value. Scientists need to have an agreed system or the resulting
confusion could lead to electrocution. Also, we need to be able
to compare alternating current with direct current. DC has the
voltage and current values constant and always in the same
direction. Unless peak values are stated, the voltage and current
values of alternating currents are the root-mean-square values,

fig E Using an electromagnet to induce e.m.f. in a coil.
In fig E we have a pair of coils linked together by a soft iron
core. Iron is extremely good at carrying magnetism and, in the
set-up shown, virtually all the magnetic field generated by the
primary coil on the left would interact with the secondary coil
on the right. When the primary switch is first closed, the primary
suddenly produces a magnetic field that was not previously there.
This means that a changing magnetic field is now within the
secondary coil. This sudden change of flux linkage will generate
an e.m.f. in the secondary. However, once the electromagnetic
field is stable there will no longer be any change in flux linkage
over time, and so there will be no further induced e.mn.f in the
secondary. The voltmeter needle will kick and then return to zero.

The magnetic field strength is usually maximised by making the
coil's core out of soft iron. Some motors use electromagnets to
provide the field, and these could be strengthened by increasing
the current through them.
F = Bev
The motor effect happens because a charged particle moving at
right angles to a magnetic field feels a force on it at right angles to
its direction of motion and also at right angles to the field. If the
charged particle is constrained - like an electron in a current in
a wire โ then the force will be transferred to the wire itself. If the
particle is flying freely, its direction will change and it will travel a
circular path whilst in the magnetic field (fig B).
fig A Investigating the strength of the force on a current-carrying
conductor in a magnetic field.
The strength of the force, F, on a wire which has a current,
1, through it whilst it is in a magnetic field, B, is given by the
equation:
F=Bx/xL x sino
where L is the length of the wire within the field, and is the
angle the current makes with the lines of the magnetic field. For
simplicity, we will only consider uniform magnetic fields in which
the field lines are all parallel.
It is common to set up situations in which the angle is 90ยฐ so
that sin is a maximum and equals 1. This reduces the formula
to F= BIL which is commonly remembered by students as
Fred = BIL.
fig B Charged particles moving in a magnetic field follow a circular path as the
motor effect provides a centripetal force.
The strength of the force on a charged particle moving across a
magnetic field is given by the equation:
F=BXqXv X sin

Magnetic fields
By the end of this section, you should be able to...
. define the terms magnetic flux density, B, magnetic flux, o,
and flux linkage, Nรธ
calculate flux, flux density and flux linkage
jump to one of its ends - as the attraction is stronger towards
the end. The quantity of flux, โ (
measured in weber, Wb),
through any given area indicates the strength of the effect of
the field there. This can be determined for a particular region by
multiplying the area enclosed by the region by the component of
Aux density perpendicular to the area.
= B sind x A
If the magnetic flux is in a uniform direction and lies
perpendicular to the area in question, sin 90ยบ = 1, and the
equation simplifies to:
p = BA
WORKED EXAMPLE
Magnetic flux
In Section 7.1.1 we saw how an electric field can be represented
by lines that indicate how a charge will feel a force when placed in
the field. You are probably more familiar, though, with the everyday
effects of magnetic fields such as attracting a fridge with a magnetic
souvenir. Usually the fridge magnet moves towards the fridge rather
than the other way around, but Newton's third and second laws
of motion explain this outcome. Electric and magnetic fields are
very similar (and utterly intertwined) beasts, as we saw in Book 1,
Topic 5 with the nature of electromagnetic radiation.
Where an electric field affects charges, a magnetic field affects
poles. A region of space that will cause a magnetic pole to feel a
force is called a magnetic field.

(a) If the bar magnet in fig B(a) causes a magnetic field with a flux
density of 20 mT perpendicular to the plane of area A, how
much flux will be contained by this area if it is 10 cm??
A = 10 cm2 = 10 x 10-4m
0 = B x A = 20 x 10-3 x 10 x 10-4
D = 20 x 10-5Wb
(b) In fig B(b) the uniform magnetic field has a flux density of
5x 10-5T and is at an angle of 75ยฐ to the region of area A.
How much flux will be contained by this area if it is 1 cm??
A= 1 cmยฒ = 1 x 10-4m2
= B sin 0 x A = 5x 10-5 * sin 75ยฐ x 1 x 10-4
0 = 4.8 x 10-9Wb
fig A A magnetic field around a permanent bar magnet.
When we represent a magnetic field in a diagram, the field lines
show the direction in which a lone north pole will be pushed.
In reality, poles always exist in north and south pairs, but the
convention is to take the field as acting from north to south, and
this is the direction of arrows drawn onto magnetic field lines
(also called lines of magnetic flux). Like electric field patterns,
indeed like all field patterns, the closer the lines are together,
the stronger the field is. The term referring to the strength of a
magnetic field is the magnetic flux density, B, and the SI unit for
it is the tesla (T)
Looking at fig B, you can see that the field lines all go in and
out of the ends of the bar magnet. This forces them to be closer
together at those points, which means that the field is stronger
there. This is why a paperclip picked up by a bar magnet would
Magnetic flux density
In the situation where the flux is perpendicular to the area we
are considering, a rearrangement of the equation shows why the
quantity B is known as the magnetic flux density:
B=P
By sharing the flux over the area, B indicates how closely packed
the magnetic field lines are - how dense they are. How dense field
lines are indicates how strong the field is, so B is also known as the
magnetic field strength.

If the primary circuit is switched off, the magnetic field it produces
will suddenly disappear, and a brief e.m.f. will be induced in the
opposite direction to the switch-on voltage. The voltmeter needle
will kick in the opposite direction and then return to zero again.
WORKED EXAMPLE
Learning tip
The content in this section has been included to illustrate how
different areas of physics can be brought together in one experiment
to solve a problem. It is not required by the specification.
The iron core in fig E has a square cross-section with each side
4 cm. The primary produces a magnetic field with a strength of
0.5 T. This takes 60 ms to generate, and to die away, when the
primary circuit is switched on or off. The secondary coil has
120 turns. What e.m.f. would be induced in the secondary at the
moments of switch-on and switch-off of the primary circuit?

dt At
-(0.5 * 0.042 * 120)
60 x 10-3
E = -1.6 V
At
At switch-off, the e.m.f. induced would be the same amount but in
the opposite direction, so ฮต = 1.6 V.
The circuit and situation described above is not really of much
practical use, although it can be responsible for current surges in
circuitry, which can cause damage. The same principle is more
usefully applied in the transformer, in which an alternating current
is supplied to the primary. As this current constantly varies, the
electromagnetic field produced by the primary coil alternates,
which creates a varying induced e.m.f. in the secondary. This e.m.f.
will vary at the same rate as the AC supplied to the primary. It will
also change constantly depending on the varying rate of change
of flux linkage. This comes from the strength of the magnetic field
(which in turn depends on the number of turns on the primary
coil) and the number of turns on the secondary coil. It turns
out that the ratio of voltages between primary and secondary is
identical to the ratio of the number of turns on these coils:
V primary primary
Vsecondary secondary
This gives us the essential job of a transformer which is to
change voltage. More turns on the secondary means a step-up
transformer in which the output voltage is higher than the input
voltage and vice versa for a step-down transformer.

almost totally contained secondary coil is given by

Electromagnetic effects
Introduction
Industrial electricity generation is vital in our technological world. Virtually every device is electrically powered these
WP days, so the physics behind generating electricity is vital. Electric and magnetic fields are utterly intertwined
phenomena. Changing one either automatically generates or changes the other. However, the details of how to
maximise these effects are subtle and important.
As with all physical phenomena, the conservation of energy is paramount, and this affects the conversion of movement into
electricity. However, electrical energy being transferred into kinetic energy is also hugely important in today's world. This is
essentially the inverse effect to the generation of electricity, and we will look at it in this chapter too. Other machines such as
particle accelerators and mass spectrometers are also affected by the equations involved in this chapter, so we will highlight the
connections to these.
Finally, we will combine these effects to look a little beyond the examination specification when considering the functioning of
electrical transformers. Their interconversion of energy from electric current into magnetic fields and back again is the closest
people have come to creating a perfectly efficient machine.
All the maths you need
โข Recognising and use of appropriate units (e.g. the tesla)
โข Substituting numerical values into equations (e.g. calculate magnetic flux linkage)
โข Understanding the slope of a tangent to a curve as a measure of the rate of change (e.g. induced e.m.f. as the rate of change
of magnetic flux linkage)
โข Use of angles in 2D and 3D structures (e.g. finding the magnetic flux linkage when a coil area is at an angle to the magnetic
field direction)
โข Distinguishing between instantaneous and average rates of change (e.g. comparing the e.m.f. induced at different times as a
magnet falls through a coil)

METAL DETECTIVES
Detecting metal objects using a process involving electromagnetic induction was first proposed by
Alexander Graham Bell, also the inventor of the telephone, as a means to find the bullet within the
body of dying US President James Garfield after he had been shot by an assassin. The bullet was
not found, but the invention of the metal detector was one positive outcome of President Garfield's
demise.
METAL DETECTORS BASICS AND THEORY
their generated magnetic field is different from the transmitted
magnetic field in shape and strength. It is the altered shape of this
regenerated magnetic field that metal detectors use to detect metal
targets. (The different shape' may be in the form of a time delay.)
The regenerated magnetic field from the eddy currents causes an
alternating voltage signal at the receive coil. This is amplified by
the electronics because relatively deeply buried targets produce
signals in the receive coil which can be millions of times weaker
than the signal in the transmit coil, and thus need to be amplified to
a reasonable level for the electronics to be able to process.
In summary:
fig A Electromagnetic induction can save lives by finding buried explosives.
Metal detectors work on the principle of transmitting a
magnetic field and analysing a return signal from the target and
environment. The transmitted magnetic field varies in time,
usually at rates of fairly high-pitched audio signals. The magnetic
transmitter is in the form of a transmit coil with a varying electric
current flowing through it produced by transmit electronics. The
receiver is in the form of a receive coil connected to receive and
signal processing electronics. The transmit coil and receive coil are
sometimes the same coil. The coils are within a coil housing which
is usually simply called the coil', and all the electronics are within
the electronics housing attached to the coil via an electric cable
and commonly called the 'control box'.
This changing transmitted magnetic field causes electric currents
to flow in metal targets. These electric currents are called eddy
currents, which in turn generate a weak magnetic field, but
1 Transmit signal from the electronics causes transmit electrical
current in transmit coil.
2 Electrical current in the transmit coil causes a transmitted
magnetic field.
3 Transmitted magnetic field causes electrical currents to flow in
metal targets (called eddy currents).
4 Eddy currents generate a magnetic field. This field is altered
compared to the transmitted field.
5 Receive coil detects the magnetic field generated by eddy
currents as a very small voltage.
6 Signal from receive coil is amplified by receive electronics,
then processed to extract signal from the target, rather than
signals from other environment magnetic sources such as
Earth's magnetic field.
