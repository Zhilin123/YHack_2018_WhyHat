WORKED EXAMPLE
A forest playground has a tyre hanging from a tree branch. If the tyre behaves like a pendulum, with a
rope of 4.0 metres length, and its mass is 15 kg. A child of mass 45 kg swings on the tyre by pulling it 3.0
metres to one side (amplitude) and leaping on. What is the maximum height that the tyre reaches above
its equilibrium position?

Questions

position of 5 cm, what is its kinetic energy after 8 seconds? What is its maximum kinetic energy?
ZIf no energy were lost, a bungee jumper would continue to oscillate up and down forever. Describe the
energy changes the bungee jumper would undergo. Discuss kinetic energy, different types of potential

The worked example of the forest tyre pendulum above violates an important assumption of pendulum
dynamics, which is that the oscillations are of small amplitude, compared with the length of the
pendulum. Use a geometrical method to calculate the vertical height gained when the child holds the tyre
at the 3 m horizontal amplitude quoted. Compare your answer with the 1.1 m calculated in the worked
example, and calculate the percentage difference between the two answers.

SHM energy
By the end of this section, you should be able to...
apply the conservation of energy to undamped oscillating systems
Conservation of energy
As with any closed system, an oscillator cannot gain or lose energy, unless there is an external
influence. For example, a pendulum under water will not continue to swing for very long, as the viscous
drag on the pendulum from the water provides an external force, which can do work to remove energy
from the pendulum system. Similarly, a child on a swing can continue to oscillate, despite air resistance
removing energy, if there is also a parent pushing repeatedly (doing work) to put energy back into the
system. Such damped or forced oscillations will be dealt with in the next sections. Here we will only
consider a closed system in which no energy moves in or out of the system during its oscillations.
Energy transformations during oscillation
The kinetic energy of a pendulum varies during its swinging motion. At each end of the swing, the
bob is momentarily stationary, meaning that it has zero kinetic energy at these points. The kinetic
energy then increases steadily until it reaches a maximum, when the bob passes through the central
position and is moving with its maximum speed. The kinetic energy then decreases to reach zero at
the other amplitude position. This cycle repeats continuously. However, once swinging the pendulum
system cannot gain or lose energy. The varying kinetic energy must be changing back and forth into
another form. In this example, the other form is gravitational potential energy as the pendulum rises to
a maximum height, where it has maximum GPE at each end of the swing and drops to minimum GPE
as it passes through the lowest point (the central position). These energy changes are shown in fig A.

Displacement/m
fig A The energy in a simple harmonic oscillator is constantly being exchanged from kinetic to potential and back again,
whilst the total remains constant as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies at each moment.
Fig A could also apply for a mass bouncing on a spring. When stretched a little before release, the
spring has stored elastic potential energy. On release, the spring accelerates the mass back towards
the equilibrium position, where it has maximum kinetic energy and zero potential, and this kinetic
energy is then reconverted into elastic potential as the spring squashes in the other displacement
direction. The interconversion of potential and kinetic energies continues, and if no energy can be
lost from the system it would oscillate with the same amplitude forever.
The above discussions are exclusively for a system that cannot lose any energy. The closest we can
get to this system would be a pendulum, or mass on a spring, in a vacuum. These would be almost
free from energy losses, but air resistance will act in most real situations.

A signal generator can be connected to a vibration generator to
produce driving forces with a changeable frequency. This can then
be used to investigate the effects of damping on oscillations. You
could set up a model of an earthquake shaking a building and see
how dampers could be attached to the model, either internally or
externally, to reduce the damage caused by resonance.

Explain how some dance music that has an inaudible bass frequency
of between 5 and 10 Hz can get clubbers moving to the music.
As we saw in Book 1, Section 4.2.3, climbing ropes need to be
made of a material which will stretch slightly, without breaking,
to stop a climber from falling. This is arranged through the
construction of climbing ropes. There are many strands woven
together, and if you follow one individual strand, it forms a spiral.
The climber hanging on the rope can act like a mass hanging
on a spring. However, the material chosen must be stiff enough.
If a climber fell whilst using a bungee cord as a safety rope,
they would bounce many times before stopping. It would not be
uncomfortable, but could well cause the climber to hit the rock
face (several times!). Thus, the stiffness and construction of the
rope must be a perfect combination of stretchy so as to avoid
a sudden, painful stop to a fall, but still stiff enough to bring the
climber to a halt. After a fall, a climbing rope has been permanently
damaged and must be replaced. The rope material is ductile and
suffers a plastic deformation which acts to reduce the amplitude of
oscillations. A less stiff material could avoid replacement but would
not damp the oscillations safely. In effect, the plastic deformation
of the ductile rope material provides critical damping. Potential
oscillations are stopped before they start. During an earthquake,
steel framed buildings can absorb some of the vibration energy
because steel is ductile, so its plastic deformation damps the
oscillations.
Key definitions
Free oscillation happens when a system performs oscillations, free
from the influence of any forces from outside the system.
A natural frequency is the frequency of oscillation that a system will
take if it undergoes free oscillations.
A forced oscillation is when a system oscillates under the influence
of an external (usually repeatedly applied) force.
A driving frequency is the frequency of an external force applied to
a system undergoing forced oscillations.
Resonance describes very large amplitude oscillations that occur
when a driving frequency matches the natural frequency of a system.
Damped oscillations occur with each oscillation; there is a loss in
energy and this reduces the amplitude over time.
Damping is the material, or system, causing energy loss during each
damped oscillation.
A critically damped system occurs when damping is such that the
oscillator returns to its equilibrium position in the quickest possible
time, without going past that position.

THE WOBBLY BRIDGE
London's Millennium Footbridge opened on 10 June 2000, and immediately suffered unexpected
resonant vibrations to such a degree that many pedestrians struggled to continue walking and had to
hold onto the railings. Some even reported feeling seasick.
In conjunction with the Royal Academy of Engineering, the bridge architects, Ove Arup Partnership
produced a paper summarising the design structure, problems and solutions for this bridge.
LINKING LONDON: THE MILLENNIUM BRIDGE
The number of pedestrians allowed onto the bridge was reduced on
Sunday 11 June, and the movements occurred far more rarely. On the
12 June it was decided to close the bridge in order to fully investigate the
cause of the movements.
NA
fig B A pattern of dampers installed on the Millennium Bridge has reduced
oscillation amplitudes by altering the resonant frequencies.
fig A London's Millennium Bridge opened for a single day before resonance
problems meant that it had to be closed for the installation of 91 dampers.
Extract 1: Opening day
It is estimated that between 80 000 and 100 000 people crossed the bridge
during the first day.
Analysis of the video footage showed a maximum of 2000 people on the
deck at any one time, with a maximum of between 1.3 and 1.5 people per
square metre.
Unexpected movements occurred. The movements were observed to
be predominantly lateral and took place mainly on the south span, at a
frequency of around 0.8 Hz - the first south lateral mode, and on the central
span, at frequencies of just under 0.5 Hz and 0.9 Hz, the first and second
lateral modes respectively. More rarely, the movement occurred on the
north span at a frequency of just over 1.0 Hz, the first north lateral mode.
These movements were not continuous; they occurred when a large number
of pedestrians were on the bridge and died down if the number of people
on the bridge reduced, or if the people stopped walking. From observation
of the amplitude of the movements on the south and central span, the
maximum lateral acceleration experienced on the bridge was between 200 and
250 milli-g. At this level of acceleration a significant number of pedestrians
began to have difficulty in walking and held onto the balustrades for support.
The same phenomenon was not observed with any vertical modes. The bridge
behaved vertically as predicted in the design; that is, the vertical movements
that took place were within the limits defined by the British Standards.
Extract 2: Development of modification design
Unless the usage of the bridge was to be greatly restricted, only two
generic options to improve its performance were considered feasible.
The first was to increase the stiffness of the bridge to move its natural
frequency out of the range that could be excited by the lateral footfall
forces. The second was to increase the damping of the bridge such that the
resonant response could be brought under control.

Oscillations
Introduction
Oscillations are common in everyday life, and can be fun! The mathematics governing these oscillations could be
WP considered less fun, but actually is much more intuitive than it may look when all the equations are written out
together.
In this chapter we will concentrate on simple harmonic oscillations, as these are the most common and lend themselves to
useful solutions to engineering problems. We will look at how oscillations can be used for fun in everyday life, from playground
toys to nightclub music.
Oscillations can also get out of control, which can be damaging or dangerous. In Angers, France, in 1850 over 220 soldiers died
as the bridge they were crossing collapsed into the cold river below. The rhythmic marching of the soldiers is thought to have
caused the bridge to oscillate more than the corroded cables supporting it could stand. Following this disaster, and some other
similar bridge collapses, soldiers are now trained to march out of step across bridges so as to avoid generating excessive
oscillations.
We will see how such large oscillations develop and what can be done to alleviate the problems they cause. These solutions
range from car suspension systems to earthquake protection systems in skyscrapers.
All the maths you need
â€¢ Draw and use the slope of a tangent to a curve as a measure of rate of change (e.g. drawing a velocity-time graph from a
displacement-time graph)
â€¢ Use of small angle approximations (e.g. in pendulum motion)
â€¢ Changing the subject of a non-linear equation (e.g. finding the gravitational field strength from a pendulum)
â€¢ Sketching and interpreting relationships shown graphically (e.g. sine and cosine functions for displacement, velocity and
acceleration of an oscillator)
â€¢ Applying the principles of calculus (e.g. the connections between acceleration, velocity and displacement)

Bouncing and swinging
There are many things around us which oscillate (figs A and B). This means they undertake
continuously repeated movements. For example, a child's swing goes backwards and forwards
through the same positions over and over again. If left to swing freely, it will always take the same
time to complete one full swing. This would be known as its time period, T. It follows a system of
movements known as simple harmonic motion (SHM). When a system is moving in SHM, a force,
known as a restoring force, F, is trying to return the object to its equilibrium position, and this force is
proportional to the distance, x, from that equilibrium position.
F= -box
where k is a constant dependent on the oscillating system in question. The negative sign in the

4. a. Why is a certain minimum number of pedestrians needed to create the swaying
effects?
b. Why do you think that a crowd of pedestrians might start to walk in a synchronised
way, so that they exacerbate the phenomenon involved here?
5. Explain what is meant by 'lateral acceleration experienced on the bridge was between
200 and 250 milli-g'.
6. Why would the bridge suffer different variations of this problem at different frequencies?
7. a. Explain how 'viscous dampers', in which pistons connected to the bridge deck push
into oil, could reduce the problems the bridge suffered.
b. Why do you think the solution chosen was to add dampers, rather than to increase
the stiffness of the bridge?

If the damping is such that the oscillator returns to its equilibrium position in the quickest possible
time, without going past that position (known as overshooting), then it is critically damped.
Overdamping is useful in many situations, such as car suspension systems, but too much
overdamping could cause the oscillator to take a very long time to return to its equilibrium position.
You can appreciate this if you imagine a pendulum swung through treacle - an extreme example of
overdamping.

SHM mathematics
By the end of this section, you should be able to...
â€¢ use the equations for simple harmonic oscillators:
a = -w2x, X = A cost, v = -Aw sin wt,
a = -Awcoswt, w = 2nf, and T = 1/f =
â€¢ draw and interpret displacement-time and velocity-
time graphs for simple harmonic oscillators, including
understanding what the gradient represents in each case
As the object moves around the circle, its angular displacement
changes according to its angular velocity, w = Rearranging this
as 8 = wt, the displacement can be rewritten as:
x = rcos(wt)
The motion of all simple harmonic oscillators can be described by
an equation of this form. Indeed, all simple harmonic oscillators
can be described by a sine or cosine function which gives their
displacement, velocity and acceleration over time. In the case
of a pendulum bob, the radius of the circle is replaced by the
amplitude of the pendulum's swing. The expression for the
displacement becomes:
x = A coswt because at t= 0 x= A

angular velocity is:

fig A Relationships in circular motion.
In Section 6.2.1, we also saw the relationships:
T=
T=27
Therefore, for an object moving in a circle:
w = 2
The movement of an oscillating object follows a similar pattern to
that of circular motion, so all of these equations are valid in SHM.
For an object performing SHM, we can determine its angular
velocity, despite the fact that it may not actually be moving in a
circle. Its motion is the projection of motion in a circle.
In fig A, consider the horizontally projected distance to the object
from the vertical axis, and how this changes over time as the object
rotates around the circle. When the object is at A, this projected
distance is equal to the radius of the circle, r, but at position B this
distance is shown by OC. You could calculate OC from:
x=rcos
SHM graphs
For an object to be moving with SHM the restoring force must,
by definition, be proportional to the displacement, F= -kx. As
we can describe the position using y= A Coswt, this gives the
equation for the force over time as:
F= -kA coswt
Not all SHM oscillations involve a spring, so here k refers to some
constant relevant to the oscillator set-up. From Newton's second
law, we can also show that:
ma = -lox
so: a = m = m A coswt
From this we can see that the acceleration and displacement in
SHM have the same form, but the acceleration acts in the opposite
direction to the displacement. When the displacement is zero,
so is the acceleration. And when x is at its maximum value, the
acceleration is also at its maximum value (fig B).

We can calculate the velocity of an oscillator at any moment from
the gradient of the displacement-time graph. For a function,
x= sind, the derivative function, which tells us the gradient
at each point, is = cosÃ©. For x = cos8, the derivative function
is = -sind. (Remember, 0 is a function of time.)
If x= A cos wi, then the change in displacement with time is given

Investigating damping
fig E How does damping affect oscillations?
In fig E, you can see how to investigate the effects of greater or lesser damping. The card sail will act as an
air resistance, and altering its size will change its damping effect, making the amplitude decrease more or
less rapidly. Can you make a card sail that provides critical damping?
Resonance problems and damping solutions
Damping solutions to real problems, such as the noisy washing machine, can be designed into new
products and structures (fig F). As objects will be inclined to oscillate with large amplitudes at their
natural frequency, this is generally the frequency at which these engineering solutions are most often
aimed. Creating damping systems that are a happy mediurn between underdamping, critical damping
and severe overdamping is a tough problem for engineers in many real situations, especially as many
objects have several natural frequencies.
In some cases, the amplitude of resonant oscillations can be so great that they damage the system. This
is what ha
is what happens when an opera singer breaks a wine glass by singing loudly at just the right pitch (fig G).
For some oscillators (e.g. clocks) we want minimum damping; for others (e.g. a mountain bike
shock-absorbing system (fig H)) we want oscillations to stop as fast as possible. To make this happen
requires an exact damping system ('critical damping') so that the system returns to equilibrium
without overshooting.

fig C For small oscillations, the component of a pendulum's weight force
pushing it back to equilibrium is proportional to its horizontal
distance from equilibrium, so it will execute SHM.
Using the set-up in fig C, it is easy to find out a lot of detail about the
oscillation of a pendulum. An ultrasonic position sensor can take
hundreds of readings every second to produce an extremely detailed
displacement-time graph for the pendulum bob. The ultrasonic
datalogging sensor can also measure the velocity at each reading by
making a calculation of the change in position divided by the time
between readings. This will allow a velocity-time graph to be drawn.
However, you should remember from simple mechanics that the
gradient of a displacement-time graph at any point gives the velocity
at that moment. Thus the v-t graph could be generated
mathematically from the d-t graph.
To make the pendulum oscillate, you would hold it to one side, to a
small maximum displacement, and release it. This maximum
displacement from the equilibrium position is the amplitude, A. It
will always be stationary, zero velocity, at the amplitude
displacement, and at the same position on the other side of the
swing. As it swings from one stationary position to the other, it
accelerates to a maximum velocity and then slows down again to a
stop. This all happens symmetrically, with the maximum velocity
occurring in the middle, at zero displacement. As the restoring force
is proportional to the displacement, this means that acceleration will
be maximum at amplitude and zero when the displacement is zero
in the middle (more details on the mathematics involved in this
experiment are given in Section 13.1.2).
You may notice that the amplitude reduces slightly over time, but
this should not affect the time period for your pendulum. If the
period is independent of the amplitude, such oscillations are known
as isochronous.

Kev definitions
To oscillate is to undertake continuously repeated movements.
A period is the time taken for one complete oscillation.
Simple harmonic motion is when a system is oscillating such that a
force is trying to return the object to its centre position and this force
is proportional to the distance from that centre position.

The set-up in fig B allows us to monitor the amplitude of vibrations of a mass on a spring, as we force it to

fig B Forced oscillations can be set up at a desired driving frequency
From previously, we know that a mass oscillating on a spring follows the equation for its time period:
T= 24
m
The time period will be the reciprocal of the natural frequency.f, and this is also the resonant frequency:
= 27 m
Thus, by finding the resonant frequency, from monitoring the amplitude of forced oscillations, we could
determine an unknown mass that is hanging on the spring:
47252
The spring constant, k, could be found by measuring the resonant frequency for a known mass and
rearranging the equation to find k:
k = 472f2m
Make sure you have a good understanding of this pratical as your understanding of the experimental
method may be assessed in your examinations.
Damped oscillations
Damped oscillations suffer a loss in energy in each oscillation and this reduces the amplitude over
time (fig C).
If a system is performing SHM at its natural frequency, its energy may still be dissipated through a
friction force acting on the system, or the plastic deformation of a ductile material in the system. If a
pendulum is left to swing without interference, its amplitude will constantly decrease with each swing
through air resistance and internal stresses within the flexing material of the string. These effects
could be amplified if we were to attach a small sail to catch the air. This artificial increasing of the air
resistance is an example of damping (or in fact an increase in the damping, as there would already
be a tiny air resistance force on the pendulum). Note that although the amplitude decreases, the
period remains constant throughout.
The amount of damping may vary, which will change how quickly the amplitude is reduced. If the
oscillator completes several oscillations, the amplitude will decrease exponentially. This is known
as underdamping (sometimes called light damping). Swinging the pendulum in a bowl of water will
make its amplitude of oscillation drop very rapidly, and it might not even complete one cycle. This is
known as overdamping

Resonance and damping
By the end of this section, you should be able to...
explain the distinction between free and forced oscillations
define the phenomenon of resonance
describe how damping affects oscillations, how damping can be caused, and its uses and
implications
Free and forced oscillations
Releasing a pendulum from its maximum amplitude and letting it swing freely (preferably in a
vacuum) is an example of free oscillation. The situation is set up for a continuous exchange of
potential and kinetic energy, caused by a restoring force which is proportional to the displacement.
Any oscillating system has a natural frequency - the frequency at which it naturally chooses to
oscillate when left alone.
However, oscillators can be forced to behave in a different way to their natural motion. If, as a
pendulum swung one way, you were to push in the opposite direction, it would turn back By
repeated applications of forces from your hand in different directions, you could force the pendulum
to oscillate at some other frequency. This would then be forced oscillation - not SHM - and the
frequency at which you were causing it to swing at would be your driving frequency.
Forcing oscillations involves adding energy to a system whilst it oscillates. Unless this is done at the
natural frequency, the system is unlikely to undergo SHM and will dissipate the energy quite quickly.
This is what happens if you push a child on a swing at the wrong moment in the oscillation.
Resonance
If a system or object is forced to vibrate at its natural frequency, it will absorb more and more energy,
resulting in very large amplitude oscillations. This is resonance. If your washing machine is very
noisy during one part of the wash cycle, the motor will be spinning at a certain frequency. This
drives vibrations in the machine at a frequency that will happen to be the natural frequency of one
of the panels, which then vibrates with very large amplitude, making a loud noise. During the rest of
the wash, the motor's rotation generates vibrations at other frequencies that do not match with the
natural frequency of any part of the machine, and it is much quieter.

will be very noisy

Pendulum dynamics
Legend has it that Galileo was just 17 when, watching a hanging lantern in the cathedral in Pisa, he
observed that a pendulum's time period is independent of the size of the oscillations. In fact, the
period for a pendulum is given by the expression:
T= 2
Therefore, the period is only dependent on the length, I. of the pendulum string, and the strength of
gravity on the planet on which it has been set up.
