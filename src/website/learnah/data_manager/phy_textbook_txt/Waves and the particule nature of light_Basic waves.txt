Energy transfer
A wave is a means for transferring energy via oscillations. Whilst energy moves from one place to
another, the waves cause no net movement of any matter.
A mechanical wave is one in which there needs to be some sort of material medium-a substance that
oscillates to allow the transfer of the energy. For example, a sound wave of a human voice transfers
energy from one person's vocal cords to another's eardrum by the repeated vibrations of air molecules.
Electromagnetic waves can transfer energy through repeated oscillations of electric and magnetic
fields, but these fields do not need matter to support them. Indeed, the interaction between
electromagnetic waves and matter generally slows their transfer of energy. For example, light travels
more slowly in water than it does in a vacuum.

TOPIC 5
Waves and the particle nature of light
CHAPTER
5.1 Basic waves
Introduction
As waves are a means to transfer energy, they have a fundamental importance to an enormous range of
phenomena. From the destruction caused by earthquakes to the determination of the chemical
composition of distant stars, to whether or not it's worth taking your surfboard to the beach this weekend,
we study waves in virtually every sphere of human experience.
Topic 5 covers many aspects of the science behind waves, and in this chapter we will begin this study with
some basic definitions and the wave equation. As waves and wave mathematics are relevant to many areas
of future study, it is important to understand these basic definitions well.
Even when scientists look to new areas of study, they often find that wave motions are the basis of
WP
what they are trying to understand. The fundamental causes of gravity have never been well
understood, and the experimental search for gravitational waves in order to expand that
understanding is currently being undertaken by a number of universities around the world.
All the maths you need
• Units of measurement (e.g. the hertz, Hz)
Use of standard form and ordinary form (e.g. using the speed of light)
Changing the subject of an equation (e.g. using the wave equation)
Solving algebraic equations (e.g. comparing the two equations for wave speed)
Substituting numerical values into algebraic equations (e.g. a radar calculation to find the distance to an
aeroplane)

Let us start by considering the nature of the writing in the webpages.

1. The extract opposite is from educational webpages produced by the U.S. Geological
Survey. The USGS is a U.S. government funded organisation researching all geological
matters. Consider the extract and comment on the type of writing that is used. Try and
answer the following questions:
a. Why would the USGS spend time and money producing these and many other
similar) webpages?
b. Discuss the audience you believe the USGS is aiming at, considering the scientific
depth in this extract, along with the style of presentation of the science.
On this page we only
have an extract: it would
be helpful to visit the
webpages and see all the
different sections that it
covers in their entirety.
Now we will look at the physics in detail. Some of these questions will link to topics earlier in
this book, so you may need to combine concepts from different areas of physics to work out the
answers. Use the timeline at the bottom of the page to help you put this work in context with what
you have already learned in your course.
2. Explain which wave type (transverse or longitudinal) is shown by each of the earthquake
waves.
3. Why can't S-waves travel through air or liquids, including the liquid iron outer core
inside the Earth?
4. Why would the waves travel faster, the deeper they are in the Earth?
a. Explain how the information on the seismogram in fig E could be used to work out
the distance to the earthquake. Calculate this distance.
b. Further, explain why this distance alone cannot determine where the earthquake
occurred.

Basic waves

WP Wave measurements
come back to exact synchronisation. At this point, the distance
between the two microphones is exactly one wavelength, A. We set
the frequency on the signal generator, and so the wave equation can
be used to find the speed: v = fx.
There are a number of important properties of waves that
scientists measure for various purposes. In most cases, you can
determine these from the graphs shown in fig A and fig B.
Displacement: the position of a particular point on a wave, at a
particular instant in time, measured from the mean (equilibrium)
position. (Symbol: various, often x; SI units: m.)
Amplitude: the magnitude of the maximum displacement
reached by an oscillation in the wave. (Symbol: A; SI units: m.)
Frequency: the number of complete wave cycles per second.
This may sometimes be measured as the number of complete
waves passing a point per second. (Symbol: f; SI units: hertz, Hz.)
Wavelength: the distance between a point on a wave and the
same point on the next cycle of the wave. For example, the
distance between adjacent wave peaks. (Symbol: A: SI units: m.)
Period: the time taken for one complete oscillation at one point
on the wave. This will also be the time taken for the wave to travel
one wavelength. (Symbol: T; SI units: s.)
Phase: the stage a given point on a wave is through a complete
cycle. Phase is measured in angle units, as a complete wave cycle
is considered to be the same as travelling around a complete circle,
that is 360° or 27 radians. (No standard symbol; SI units: rad.)
Wave speed: the rate of movement of the wave - the same as
speed in general. (Symbol: v, or c for speed of electromagnetic
waves; SI units: ms.)
You can find the speed of a wave from distance divided by
time, as with the speed of anything. However, as each wave has
a certain wavelength, and the frequency tells us how many of
these wavelengths pass per second, you can also find the speed
by multiplying frequency and wavelength together. This is often
referred to as the wave equation:
wave speed (ms-') = frequency (Hz) x wavelength (m)

Pulse-echo measurements
The natural habitat for bats tends to be woodland, and they fly
through the trees at 10–15 kmh-!, depending on species. For
catching insects, the bats need to be able to sense their location
precisely. Whilst their vision is better than the old simile 'blind as a
bat' implies, their well-known echolocation system, using very high
frequency (50-100 kHz) sound pulses, gives a much more detailed
perception of the world at distances of less than 5 metres. At
greater distances, the echo is attenuated too much for the bat to
use. But how does it work? The bat will make a 'chirp through
its nose. This sound pulse will typically last 3 milliseconds. When
the sound hits nearby objects, it will be reflected back to the
bat's sensitive ears and its brain can accurately measure the time
between pulse emission and echo reception. The bat's brain has
also evolved to instinctively calculate the distance to the reflecting
object using the equation: distance = speed x time.
Experiments with dolphins have shown that they use a similar
echolocation system, but for them it is so sophisticated that
dolphins can build up a mental image of the shapes of nearby
objects. They can see' with sound. This is probably also true for
bats, to ensure that they eat an insect and not an insect-sized
leaf, but dolphins can respond to experimental inquiry in a more
conclusive manner than bats.
Investigation
Investigating the speed of sound
Using the simple definition of wave speed that is distance divided by
time, we can use a twin beam oscilloscope to find the extra time a
sound takes to travel a short extra distance. One beam trace shows a
sound picked up by a microphone held 50 cm from the loudspeaker.
The other trace shows the same sound, picked up by a second
microphone held further from the loudspeaker. The difference in
positions of the peaks on the two oscilloscope traces shows the time
taken, t, for the sound to travel the extra distance, d. If we measure
this carefully, then the speed will be given by:
It can be difficult to make accurate measurements from the screen of
an oscilloscope, so we need to synchronise the traces to minimise
the effect of random error in taking such a measurement. Firstly, with
both microphones at the same distance from the loudspeaker, the
two traces appear in identical phase positions in phase). If we slide
the second microphone slowly away from the loudspeaker, we will
move the traces out of phase with each other until eventually they

objects in murky waters.

Sound travels at 330 ms in air. If the sound of thunder arrives 3.75s
after the lightning flash is seen, how far away was the lightning strike?
Ultraviolet light has a wavelength of 368 nm. What is the frequency
of this light?
We have developed similar pulse-echo ranging and imaging
systems in a very wide range of technological applications, from
sonar on ships and submarines to air traffic control radar, medical
imaging and the measurement of distance to asteroids and to
the Moon. This is particularly useful in situations where other
methods might be difficult or hazardous. For example, Venus has a
very hot, high pressure, atmosphere with sulfuric acid clouds that
block our view of the surface. Mapping the surface using a remote
radar technique has avoided the need to land on the planet.
WORKED EXAMPLE
An air traffic control system sends out a pulse of radio waves that
are reflected by a jumbo jet. The reflection is picked up by the
radio dish 0.007 seconds after the emission of the pulse. How far
away is the plane?
Explain why the two equations for wave speed are actually the same
calculation.

compressions, and areas of lower pressure are called rarefactions.
describe transverse waves
Transverse waves
A transverse wave is one where the movements of the particles,
or fields in an electromagnetic wave, are up and down, or left and
right, whilst the energy travels forwards. This is illustrated in
fig A, where the girl is vibrating the rope up and down, but the
energy travels along the rope towards the boy. As the girl moves
the rope up and down, the particles pull their neighbours up
and down. These then pass the vibration on to their neighbours,
through their intermolecular forces, and the wave moves along
the rope.
Graphing waves
In fig A of Section 5.1.1 we saw how waves can be shown on a
graph of displacement versus distance. This is relatively easy with
a transverse wave, as the graph appears like a picture of the wave,
so it is easy to comprehend. The wavelength can be found by
measuring along the graph's x-axis from one point on a wave cycle
to the same point on the next wave cycle. Amplitude is measured
from the x-axis vertically to a maximum displacement point.
Longitudinal waves are less easy to visualise from their graph, and
vice versa. Fig C illustrates how a longitudinal wave can also be
represented on a graph of displacement versus distance along the
wave. With the longitudinal wave transposed in this way, so that it
has the same graphical appearance as a transverse wave, you can
measure its wavelength and amplitude easily from the graph in
exactly the same way as for the transverse wave.

fig C A longitudinal wave can be easier to measure if it is drawn on a

Longitudinal waves
A longitudinal wave in a fluid, such as air, is generated by
squashing particles together and then stretching them apart from
each other, repeatedly - thus vibrating them 'longitudinally'. The
areas of higher pressure cause the particles to push apart from
each other, but this makes the particles move and squash their
neighbours, and this higher pressure - a compression - then
pushes them away to squash their neighbours. Similarly, the areas
where there are too few particles (compared with the uniform
spread of the particles when the wave is not present) cause
particles to move into the vacant space - the rarefaction - filling
it up, but causing a vacancy behind these particles, and the wave
moves along. An example of a longitudinal wave in a solid material
can be seen by squashing and releasing a slinky spring, as shown
in fig B.
Longitudinal waves in action
Sound waves are caused by oscillations of particles of the medium
(in fig D the medium is air), causing compressions and rarefactions
along the line of movement of the wave. Areas of higher pressure
and lower pressure in the air continue the movement of the
vibrations. An area of higher pressure, a compression, will occur
when the particles on either side are displaced towards it, meaning
particles are displaced in opposite directions towards each other to
squash together and increase the pressure, as shown in fig E.

EARTHQUAKE!
Earthquakes are among the most deadly natural hazards. There are around 100 earthquakes each
year of a size that could cause serious damage.
In this activity, we will look at some of the detail about the detection of earthquake waves.
EARTHQUAKE FAQS
What is an earthquake and what causes them to happen?
An earthquake is caused by a sudden
slip on a fault. The tectonic plates
are always slowly moving, but
they get stuck at their edges due to
friction. When the stress on the edge
overcomes the friction, there is an
earthquake that releases energy in
waves that travel through the Earth's
crust and cause the shaking that we fig A
feel.
What are seismograms? How do you read them?
Seismograms are the records (paper copy) produced by
seismographs used to calculate the location and magnitude of an
earthquake. They show how the ground moves with the passage of
time. On a seismogram, the HORIZONTAL axis = time (measured
in seconds) and the VERTICAL axis= ground displacement
(usually measured in millimeters). When there is NO EQ reading
there is just a straight line except for small wiggles caused by local
disturbance or "noise' and the time markers.

What is a P-wave? An S-wave?
When an earthquake occurs, it releases energy in the form of
seismic waves that radiate from the earthquake source in all
directions. The different types of energy waves shake the ground
in different ways and also travel through the earth at different
velocities. The fastest wave, and therefore the first to arrive at a
given location, is called the P-wave. The P-wave, or compressional
wave, alternately compresses and expands material in the same
direction it is travelling. The S-wave is slower than the P-wave and
arrives next, shaking the ground up and down and back and forth
perpendicular to the direction it is travelling. Surface waves follow
the P- and S-waves.
fig D There are many different types seismometers, but they all are based on
the fundamental principle - that the differential motion between a free
mass (which tends to remain at rest) and a supporting structure anchored
in the ground (which moves with the vibrating Earth) can be used to
record seismic waves.
